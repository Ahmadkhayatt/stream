Scammers Are Posing As Airline Customer Service Agents Amid Delays & Cancelations,US officals and airlines are warning of an increase in scams related to ongoing travel disruptions and delays. The Federal Trade Commission and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have warned of a sharp rise in people impersonating airlines and travel companies. Scammers are taking advantage of these recent travel disruptions by targeting flyers who reach out to airlines online.,"US officals and airlines are warning of an increase in scams related to ongoing travel disruptions and delays. The Federal Trade Commission and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have warned of a sharp rise in people impersonating airlines and travel companies to access personal information.Travelers across the United States have been faced with an increase in travel disruptions in recent days. First, a technical outage grounded flights nationwide, and now Hurricane Debby has hit Florida as a Category 1 storm. As of press time on Monday, over 1,660 flights have been canceled nationwide, according to data from FlightAware.Discover more 
aviation news about the passenger experience
 here.Airports in Florida are understandably the most affected, with more than one in ten flights out of Orlando, Miami, and Tampa. American Airlines, which has a significant hub at Miami International Airport (MIA), is the most severely affected, with 380 flights canceled today across its network, representing 10% of the airline's schedule. Southwest Airlines also faces a significant impact and has cut 250 flights today (5% of its network). Delta Air Lines, its regional subsidiary Endeavor Air, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, and JetBlue each canceled over 100 flights today.Scammers are taking advantage of these recent travel disruptions by targeting flyers who reach out to airlines online. These scammers crawl social media, looking for posts from upset travelers before reaching out through fake social media accounts pretending to be an airline customer service representative who's there to help.Officials say they plan to keep the airport “open and operational” throughout the storm.Once connected, the scammers often ask passengers for information, like their booking confirmation number, phone number, or bank account. In other instances, they direct passengers to a spoofed site that looks like an airline webpage but actually harvests their personal information to steal the passenger’s identity or rack up charges on their accounts. The Federal Trade Commission is taking this seriously, issuing the following warning to customers nationwide:Whether the issues are the result of an unprecedented event like the Crowdstrike glitch that grounded thousands of flights worldwide, or more common disturbances like weather delays, desperate travelers often turn to social media for help from the airlines.""Opportunistic scammers know this, and they’re lurking behind fake accounts trying to steal travelers’ information.""Many airlines offer a customer support account on X and other social media platforms, a fact the scammers took advantage of when airline websites briefly went down during the outage. This led passengers to see alternative methods of communication regarding affected flights, including reaching out publicly online.There are several ways to prevent falling into this trap, which can affect even the most seasoned travelers. Here are several key tips provided by the Department of Transportation to ensure that you do not get re-routed to an airline impersonator:When in doubt, asking the presumed representative to contact you back through official channels, such as the airline's website, is a wise choice. Anyone whose personal information has been compromised can go to IdentityTheft.gov to report it and get recovery steps. Imposters can be reported to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.","ABD'li officals ve havayolu şirketleri, sürmekte olan seyahat kesintileri ve gecikmeleriyle ilgili bir yolsuzluk artışı konusunda uyarıyorlar.

Jackpot: Man Wins $1.5 Million From Slot Machine At Las Vegas’ Harry Reid Airport,"Passenger was playing the Wheel of Fortune machine close to Gate E-10 in Terminal 3 last week when he won just shy of $1.5 million. There have been three jackpot winners in the past two years. Harry Reid International Airport is one of only two airports in the country where gambling is permitted, the other being Reno-Tahoe International Airport.","One lucky traveler has hit the jackpot on a slot machine at Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) in Las Vegas. The passenger was playing the Wheel of Fortune machine close to Gate E-10 in Terminal 3 last week when he won just shy of $1.5 million.According to Monika Bertaki, a spokesperson from Harry Reid International Airport, the facility contributes a significant amount of revenue to the airport. As reported by NBC, there have been three jackpot winners in the past two years. Earlier this year, the airport took to Twitter to share the news of another winner, who took home $1,031,200:Harry Reid International Airport is one of only two airports in the country where gambling is permitted, the other being Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO). In a city famed for its gambling establishments and that attracts millions of visitors each year, it seems logical that passengers would have the option to carry on playing while they wait for their flight home.The facility is currently the eighth-busiest airport in the US, ahead of Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) and behind Orlando International Airport (MCO). 2023 was the airport's busiest year on record, with 57.6 million passengers, beating its pre-pandemic peak of 51.5 million passengers. While the vast majority of its routes are domestic, the airport is also served from a handful of international destinations, including:Last week's lucky jackpot winner was flying home to San Diego (SAN), which was the ninth-busiest route from the airport last year, with 779,000 passengers across all airlines - Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Spirit Airlines.The region is in desperate need of a higher-capacity reliever airport.With so much focus on Las Vegas' Harry Reid International Airport, it is also worth mentioning Nevada's second-busiest airport, Reno-Tahoe International Airport. Although it does not act as a hub for any airline, it is served by a wide variety of carriers from destinations across the country, including New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), Chicago (ORD), and Atlanta (ATL). The airport's only international route is to Guadalajara (GDL), operated by the Mexican low-cost carrier Volaris.Last year, the three busiest routes from Reno-Tahoe International Airport were:The airline says it will cease airport operations on January 7th.For this one lucky passenger, their experience of flying out of Harry Reid International Airport will be one to remember!","Yolcu, geçen hafta Terminal 3'te E-10 Kapı'na yakındaki Fortune Kolası makinesini oynarken 1,5 milyon dolar kazanmıştı.

FAA Proposes Inspection Of Boeing 787 Dreamliner Landing Gear,"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has proposed an airworthiness directive (AD) after the company had reported to the FAA that certain inspections of the Boeing 787 main landing gear (MLG) were not performed during the production process. If not addressed, the condition could result in a collapse of the MLG, resulting in the loss of directional control.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has proposed an airworthiness directive (AD) after the company had reported to the FAA that certain inspections of the Boeing 787 main landing gear (MLG) were not performed during the production process.Providing background about the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), the FAA detailed that it received a report from Boeing that during the manufacturing process of four drag brace lower link assemblies of the MLG, a fluorescent penetrant inspection was not performed.“The subsequent investigation determined that the quality escape was caused by human error and has been isolated to a single technician. Undetected cracks could lead to fracture of the drag brace lower lock link assembly.”The regulator warned that if not addressed, the condition could result in a collapse of the MLG, resulting in the loss of directional control while the aircraft is on the ground and even potentially increasing the risk of a runway excursion or the penetration of the wing box fuel tank.The Boeing Dreamliner ran off the right side of the runway and needed to be towed free. No injuries or damage have been reported.According to the proposed rulemaking’s text, the AD was based on Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin (RB) B787-81205-SB320048-00 RB, Issue 001, issued on November 20, 2023.However, while the RB designated that the affected aircraft were line numbers (LN) from 6 to 1168, inclusive, the FAA stated that the proposed directive included all Boeing 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 aircraft.“Because the affected drag brace lower lock link assemblies are rotable parts, the FAA has determined that these parts could later be installed on airplanes that were initially delivered with acceptable drag brace lower lock link assemblies, thereby subjecting those airplanes to the unsafe condition.”Still, its early estimates determined that 156 aircraft would be affected in the United States. While ch-aviation data showed that Boeing has delivered 132 787s to US-based operators, Brian West, the chief financial officer (CFO) and executive vice president of finance of Boeing, detailed during the manufacturer’s Q2 earnings call on July 31 that it still had aircraft in its inventory, which should liquidate as the production performance improves.While the company announced massive losses, Boeing hopes its new CEO and quality and safety improvement plan will turn its fortunes around.The FAA has invited stakeholders to comment on the NPRM until September 16. After responding to the comments in the directive’s text, the regulator will publish its final rule AD.Nevertheless, the regulator mandated inspections or a records check, which should take operators up to one hour of labor, at an estimated cost of $85 per aircraft.If necessary, replacing a single drag brace lower lock link assembly would take up to 18 work hours at a cost of $85 per hour, amounting to $1,530 per aircraft. In addition, with parts-related expenses of $39,119, the replacements would set back airlines $40,649 per 787.The FAA noted that some expenses related to compliance with the directive could be covered under warranty.In May, Boeing disclosed that one of its employees falsified inspection records at the North Charleston, South Carolina, facility where the manufacturer has been assembling the 787.At the time, Scott Stocker, the vice president and general manager of the 787 program of Boeing, affirmed that the misconduct did not result in an immediate safety of flight issue.Responding to the proposed directive, a Boeing spokesperson reiterated to Simple Flying that the NPRM was issued following the RB in November 2023, with no in-service incidents resulting from the potentially unsafe condition that the FAA flagged.Boeing told the FAA of its findings and invited employees to come forward if anything odd was discovered.","Federal Havacılık İdaresi (FAA), şirketin Boeing 787 ana atış cihazının (MLG) bazı kontrollerinin üretim süreci sırasında yapılmadığının FAA'ya bildirilmesi üzerine bir uçağın uyarabilirlik direktivesi (AD) önermişti.

Cebu Pacific Adds Airbus A330neo Flights To Melbourne And Shelves Beijing Service,"Southeast Asia has taken longer than any other region to recover to pre-pandemic levels, hampered by the extended and strict travel restrictions in Northeast Asia. That's all in the past, and now the airlines in the region have returned most of their aircraft capacity. Cebu Pacific is adding an additional weekly flight, and when that commences, it will operate the route four times weekly.","Southeast Asia has taken longer than any other region to recover to pre-pandemic levels, hampered by the extended and strict travel restrictions in Northeast Asia that deprived it of the inbound leisure and business traffic it had relied on. That's all in the past, and now the airlines in the region have returned most of their aircraft capacity, it is once again close to pre-COVID levels.On Friday, Melbourne Airport (MEL) announced that the Philippine's low-cost carrier, Cebu Pacific, will increase services between Manila and Melbourne in December. To meet growing demand, Cebu Pacific is adding an additional weekly flight, and when that commences, it will operate the route four times weekly with its Airbus A330neo widebody jets.The additional Cebu Pacific (Cebu) service will take capacity in the Philippines market above pre-pandemic levels for the first time, mirroring the shift at Melbourne Airport, which has firmly transitioned from recovery to growth. Cebu currently operates the route three times weekly, and the increase is a good indicator of the recovery in Southeast Asian air travel.Melbourne Airport is close to full recovery to pre-pandemic levels and is already planning a third runway to handle 76 million passengers in 2042.Melbourne Airport Chief of Aviation Jim Parashos said that since the pandemic, the airport had seen Southeast Asia emerge as one of its best-performing markets, with three of the four fastest-growth countries coming from that region. The Philippines market has grown by 43%, while Vietnam and Thailand have grown by 60% and 25%, respectively. Parashos added:""The number of international students coming from the Philippines to Australia to study has doubled since 2019. Due to the high demand, we are working with Cebu Pacific to increase this service further and are hopeful they will move to five flights a week in the not-too-distant future.""According to ch-aviation, Cebu has a total fleet of 70 Airbus aircraft, comprising 19 A320-200s, 19 A320neos, seven A321-200s, 15 A321neos, one A330-300 and nine A330-900neos. The data also lists the airline has 33 aircraft on order, including eight A320neos, eight A321neos, ten A321XLRs and seven A330-900neos.Launching extra services can often mean shifting capacity from somewhere else, and on this occasion, it has emerged that Cebu is deferring its plans to resume flying between Manila and Beijing. Today, a report from the Philippines outlet, the Inquirer, said Cebu has ""indefinitely postponed"" the relaunch due to a lack of demand.The route from Manila Ninoy Aquino International Airport (MNL) to Beijing was suspended during the pandemic, and since last year, Cebu has been contemplating a return to the Chinese capital. In 2019, Beijing welcomed 97.7 million tourists, but in 2023, only 35.5 million arrived, despite the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.Cebu Pacific already has one of the youngest fleets in Asia but with seven new Airbus jets arriving already in 2024 it's getting younger.Cebu Pacific President and CEO Xander Lao said the airline was not seeing a quick recovery in China and that ""clearly the demand has not been as robust compared to 2019."" Despite that, Cebu resumed flights to Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Xiamen last year, and competitors Philippine Airlines and AirAsia Philippines have reopened their China Network following the reopening. Lao added:""We are moving some of our routes from China to other places such as Chiang Mai, and you'll see a few more announcements hopefully in the next couple of weeks.""On August 1, Cebu announced it would introduce nonstop flights between Manila and Chiang Mai in northern Thailand, commencing on October 29, 2024. The service will operate from Manila to Chiang Mai three times weekly, on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, with the return flights operating on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays.We'd love to see you on

!It will be the airline's fourth route between the Philippines and Thailand, with Cebu services operating from Cebu and Manila to Bangkok, giving passengers the option of flying to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi International (BKK) or Don Mueang International (DMK). Cebu currently operates flights to 35 domestic and 26 international destinations across Asia, Australia, and the Middle East.","Güneydoğu Asya'da, kuzeydoğu Asya'daki uzatılmış ve katı seyahat kısıtlamaları yüzünden engellenen patlama öncesi seviyelere ulaşmak için herhangi bir bölgeden daha uzun zaman aldı.

JetBlue CFO Says TrueBlue Loyalty Program Could Be A Source Of Collateral,"JetBlue reported a net loss of $310 million for the period, although this represents an improvement compared to the $362 million net loss it experienced in 2022. According to regulatory filings, JetBlue held $5.3 billion of long-term debt as of the end of June, including finance lease obligations. The airline is using its loyalty program to secure new lines of credit.","In recent years, the airline has faced significant challenges. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has secured two critical legal victories against JetBlue , successfully breaking up the Northeast Alliance (NEA) and preventing the planned merger with Spirit Airlines.Adding to the company's difficulties, JetBlue reported a net loss of $310 million for the period, although this represents an improvement compared to the $362 million net loss it experienced in 2022.According to Bloomberg, during an earnings call, JetBlue's CFO Ursula Hurley informed that the company possesses approximately $11 billion in unencumbered assets, which are not currently pledged as collateral.She mentioned that these assets could be utilized to obtain fresh financing. Additionally, Hurley noted that around half of this amount is attributed to the company's loyalty program. The company's balance sheet categorizes any current debt due to maturity within 12 months, including debts due in 2025. According to regulatory filings, JetBlue held $5.3 billion of long-term debt as of the end of June, including finance lease obligations.According to the Cambridge English Dictionary, collateral is a valuable asset owned by an individual applying for a loan. The lender pledges this asset to guarantee the loan's repayment.If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender has the right to take possession of the collateral as a form of payment.This arrangement provides security for the lender and can help borrowers qualify for loans they might not otherwise be able to obtain.Airlines can use various assets as collateral, including high-value airplanes, which can be worth over $100 million. However, using airplanes as collateral carries the risk of the airline ceasing operations if the aircraft are seized.To mitigate this risk, airlines such as United and American Airlines have chosen to use their frequent flier programs as collateral. While not as critical to the carrier's operations as the airplanes, the frequent flier programs provide a valuable alternative asset for securing financing or other arrangements.The airline is using its loyalty program to secure new lines of credit.It was reported JetBlue Airways Corp.'s loyalty program might be collateral if the airline decides to seek financing in the debt capital markets. The chief financial officer of JetBlue mentioned on Tuesday, 30 July, that the airline aims to address convertible maturities as swiftly as possible. This indicates the company's proactive approach to managing its financial commitments and exploring potential financing options.Although it is important to note that no decisions have yet been made regarding which of the company's assets will be used, this is what Hurley told the analyst.""We're currently assessing all markets to see the most effective and the most constructive in terms of the all-in cost of funding,""","JetBlue bu dönem için 310 milyon dolarlık net kaybı bildirmesine karşın, bu rakam 2022 yılında yaşadığı 362 milyon dolarlık net kaybına kıyasla bir iyileşme anlamına geliyor.

No injuries or damage have been reported.According to the proposed rulemaking’s text, the AD was based on Boeing Alert Requirements Bulletin (RB) B787-81205-SB320048-00 RB, Issue 001, issued on November 20, 2023.However, while the RB designated that the affected aircraft were line numbers (LN) from 6 to 1168, inclusive, the FAA stated that the proposed directive included all Boeing 787-8, 787-9, and 787-10 aircraft.“Because the affected drag brace lower lock link assemblies are rotable parts, the FAA has determined that these parts could later be installed on airplanes that were initially delivered with acceptable drag brace lower lock link assemblies, thereby subjecting those airplanes to the unsafe condition.”Still, its early estimates determined that 156 aircraft would be affected in the United States. While ch-aviation data showed that Boeing has delivered 132 787s to US-based operators, Brian West, the chief financial officer (CFO) and executive vice president of finance of Boeing, detailed during the manufacturer’s Q2 earnings call on July 31 that it still had aircraft in its inventory, which should liquidate as the production performance improves.While the company announced massive losses, Boeing hopes its new CEO and quality and safety improvement plan will turn its fortunes around.The FAA has invited stakeholders to comment on the NPRM until September 16. After responding to the comments in the directive’s text, the regulator will publish its final rule AD.Nevertheless, the regulator mandated inspections or a records check, which should take operators up to one hour of labor, at an estimated cost of $85 per aircraft.If necessary, replacing a single drag brace lower lock link assembly would take up to 18 work hours at a cost of $85 per hour, amounting to $1,530 per aircraft. In addition, with parts-related expenses of $39,119, the replacements would set back airlines $40,649 per 787.The FAA noted that some expenses related to compliance with the directive could be covered under warranty.In May, Boeing disclosed that one of its employees falsified inspection records at the North Charleston, South Carolina, facility where the manufacturer has been assembling the 787.At the time, Scott Stocker, the vice president and general manager of the 787 program of Boeing, affirmed that the misconduct did not result in an immediate safety of flight issue.Responding to the proposed directive, a Boeing spokesperson reiterated to Simple Flying that the NPRM was issued following the RB in November 2023, with no in-service incidents resulting from the potentially unsafe condition that the FAA flagged.Boeing told the FAA of its findings and invited employees to come forward if anything odd was discovered.","Federal Havacılık İdaresi (FAA), şirketin Boeing 787 ana atış cihazının (MLG) bazı kontrollerinin üretim süreci sırasında yapılmadığının FAA'ya bildirilmesi üzerine bir uçağın uyarabilirlik direktivesi (AD) önermişti. Bu durum çözülmediği takdirde, MLG'nin çökerek yön kontrolünün kaybedilmesine yol açabilir.",https://simpleflying.com/faa-inspection-boeing-787-dreamliner-landing-gear/,https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/boeing-787-9-at-the-farnborough-international-airshow-2014-shutterstock_1258445287.jpg
