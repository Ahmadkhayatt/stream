SWISS Schedules Its New Shortest European Airbus A330 Flights,"Swiss has 14 A330-300s, comprising just under half of its widebody fleet. The 236-seat type will be flown to Spain on August 11, 17, 24, and 31. The ever-popular Andalusian tourist destination is 869 nautical miles (1,609 km) from Zurich.","The Airbus A330ceo is a bog-standard widebody type. While it has little distinction, at least compared to newer alternatives, it remains a workhorse. It is the number-one twin-aisle for some airlines, such as SWISS. The carrier has 14 A330-300s, comprising just under half of its widebody fleet. It will temporarily deploy the twin type on another intra-European route. And it is not Zurich-Geneva, which briefly saw the A330 in May.While the Lufthansa Group member scheduled Zurich-Malaga A330 flights in mid-July, they have only just been spotted, including by me. Like many European short-haul widebody operations, the use will be very fleeting. The 236-seat type will be flown to Spain on August 11 (Sunday), 17 (Saturday), 24 (Saturday), and 31 (Saturday), providing additional uplift on particularly important days of the week.The ever-popular Andalusian tourist destination is 869 nautical miles (1,609 km) from Zurich on a Great Circle basis. However, it would be an unusually exact 1,000 miles if statute miles were used instead. As always, it would be different in real-world operations.Malaga has seen SWISS's A330s before, just very briefly. Schedule analysis using OAG data shows that it was used in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2021, and 2023, sometimes just once. Now it is back, making a nice change from the A320s and A321s SWISS usually deploys. It is scheduled as follows, with all times local:Want tickets? Find them here!When SWISS's full twin-aisle schedule for August-December is considered, Zurich-Malaga is easily its shortest A330-operated service. It is followed by Tel Aviv, which covers three-quarters more distance, and then Dubai, Montreal, and Boston.Things are different when the analysis is expanded to include SWISS's other widebodies, the A340-300 and Boeing 777-300ER. The A330's Malaga service is the third-shortest route:It has become the world's shortest bookable A340 service, but it doesn't hang around for long.SWISS has 12 Triple 7s, which are vital not only because they have the most seats in its fleet (320, including the most in business) but also because of the highest belly freight capacity.While it is usually flown to high-capacity markets in the US, Brazil, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, it is also flown to Athens, 886 nautical miles (1,641 km) from Zurich – nearly the same distance as Malaga on the A330.The 777-300ER has served the Greek capital since April 2024 and will continue until the end of October. It operates on Fridays, departing from Switzerland at 09:25 and from Athens at 14:40.","İsviçre'nin geniş kapasite filosunun yarıdan azını oluşturan 14 adet A330-300'u bulunuyor. 236 koltuklu tipi 11, 17, 24 ve 31 Ağustos tarihlerinde İspanya'ya uçacak.

UK's Leeds Bradford Airport CEO Wants Airlines To Offer Flights To US & Middle East,"Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA) has published its master plan, ‘Vision 2030,’ envisioning the airport’s growth, including more than doubling its passenger numbers by 2045. CEO Vincent Hodder believes that providing local access to international destinations without a long journey to the airport will benefit trade and travel.","Leeds Bradford Airport (LBA) has published its master plan, ‘Vision 2030,’ envisioning the airport’s growth, including more than doubling its passenger numbers by 2045.While not many international travelers will have passed through LBA, airport CEO Vincent Hodder has a vision to change that. He believes that providing local access to international destinations without a long journey to the airport will benefit trade and travel.“Facilitating trade links for local businesses promoting local jobs for international investors is a key component of what makes Leeds Bradford Airport essential for the region.”The airport's newly released master plan, Vision 2030, noted a financial commitment of £200 million ($255 million) to improve facilities. This will be spent on several areas of LBA, including the terminal, runway, and other infrastructure around the airport, as well as a new rail station.With a mission to 'connect Yorkshire to the world,' the CEO has specified a desire for flights to both the Middle East and the USA.In 2023, LBA welcomed 4 million passengers. Some 36,000 aircraft arrive and depart from the airport annually, serving over 80 European destinations. The airport plans to gradually increase its annual passenger numbers, reaching 6 million in 2026, 7 million in 2030, and nearly 10 million by 2045.Expanding its network is a key goal for LBA. The master plan shared that its main priorities include more domestic routes, increased European connections - specifically more routes to Eastern Europe - as well as increased frequencies and choices on the most popular routes.With no long-haul carriers, connecting airlines are important to Leeds Bradford, as they can bring passengers to major hubs and onward around the world. As such, the master plan includes securing more itineraries to the largest European airports with the most generous connecting options.Lastly, the airport highlighted that it was also looking to open up destinations in the North Atlantic and the Middle East although it did not detail any specific target destinations.Nevertheless, ‘Vision 2030’ pointed out that the airport has been working with its airline partners to increase the share of new-generation aircraft at LBA.Jet2 and Ryanair, which both serve LBA, have ordered Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX family aircraft, the latest generation of commercial narrowbodies. With their increased efficiency, bringing these jets to LBA would positively impact the airport’s environmental footprint.“Developments in aircraft technology, such as the Airbus A321XLR, offer an exciting opportunity to expand our network. These new aircraft offer an extended flying range, opening up new route opportunities.”LBA hinted that these could include direct flights to the US and Canada's east coasts and Middle East destinations.The Airbus A321XLR was first certified with the CFM International LEAP-1A engines.Outside of London and its international airports, the only other English airport with many long-haul connections isManchester Airport . The North East England airport has nailed down many international flight options and has become the go-to in the region for long-haul travel.Leeds Bradford isn't a million miles from MAN - the two airports are under two hours apart by car. But Hodder believes there's a role for LBA to take that travel time away, not just from local residents, but also from those even further east from MAN in cities like York and Hull.“...demand for air travel in the region is currently under-served and, out of the eleven million yearly journeys that originate within Yorkshire, Leeds Bradford Airport serves four million.”According to data from OAG Traffic Analyzer, 730,000 roundtrip passengers traveled from MAN and LBA to various destinations on the eastern coast of the US, with more than 70% of travelers from the two UK airports choosing to fly to either New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) or Orlando International Airport (MCO).Some 85% of summer services are from the UK to just two countries.","Leeds Bradford Havaalanı (LBA), havaalanının 2045 yılına kadar yolcu sayısının iki katından fazlasını kapsayan büyümesini öngören ana planını ""Vision 2030"" olarak yayınladı. CEO Vincent Hodder, uluslararası noktalara uzun bir yolculuk yapmadan yerel erişim sağlamanın ticaret ve seyahatten fayda sağlayacağına inanıyor.",https://simpleflying.com/leeds-bradford-airport-flights-to-us-middle-east/,https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ryanair-boeing-737-departing-lba-shutterstock_2161561611.jpg
COMAC C919 Inches Closer To EU Certification With EASA Favorable Facility Audit,"The Comac C919 has been inching closer to certification in the European Union. EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) visited COMAC’s facilities in Shanghai, China. The visit included sessions inside a full-flight simulator of the Chinese-built competitor to the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max. Chinese media is reporting hopes of certification in Europe by 2025.","The Comac C919 has been inching closer to certification in the European Union (EU). The bloc’s regulators have been visiting their Chinese counterparts to assess the C919, including its simulators. The recently concluded third visit, out of a round of four, resulted in 'favorable feedback,' suggesting the regulator likes what it sees.According to a report by the South China Morning Post (SCMP), which cited sources familiar with the matter, representatives of the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) visited COMAC’s facilities in Shanghai, China.The outlet added that the EU regulator’s representatives provided positive feedback about the aircraft. The visit included sessions inside a full-flight simulator of the Chinese-built competitor to the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max .EASA’s representatives also went onboard the C919 to inspect the aircraft, spending hours in the cockpit and cabin.The C919 intends to compete with the well-established A320s and 737s.This was the third and most important stage of EASA's four-round inspection procedure, where it establishes whether the product conforms to regulatory requirements on everything from the structure to the electrical systems.While this is a long way from getting the aircraft certified, the 'positive feedback' suggests it was a 'pass' from EASA. Chinese media is reporting hopes of certification in Europe by 2025, but EASA said earlier this year that the aircraft was 'too new' to certify yet.This week, eight China Southern pilots completed the first of the airline's COMAC C919 training. The aircraft is set to be delivered to the carrier in August this year. While the aircraft is set to remain a staple in China, could we see the jet in the fleets of Western airlines? Ryanair's CEO did share that the manufacturing of the jet is good for the West as it ""will weaken the order books of both Airbus and Boeing"" and create competition. However, in terms of actual non-Asian orders, it may take a long time to be certified in Europe and the US. So, I can't imagine there will be many orders anytime soon. What do you think? Let us know below!So far, only the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has certified the C919, with the aircraft being largely reserved for flights within China.The C919 has appeared outside of China, including demonstration flights in Hong Kong in December 2023 and at the Singapore Airshow in February.On June 1, China Eastern Airlines operated a return itinerary with the C919 from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (SHA) to Hong Kong International Airport (HKG), the type’s first official commercial flight outside mainland China.The flights were operated under the flight codes MU7191 and MU7192, which have not been used again. The aircraft, registered as B-919F, has since operated only domestic routes within China.Data from aviation analytics company Cirium showed that in August, China Eastern Airlines has scheduled flights with the type to five destinations:The airline has scheduled 154 weekly itineraries with the C919, representing 24,948 weekly seats and 32.8 million available seat kilometers (ASK).On May 28, China Eastern Airlines took delivery of its sixth COMAC C919 aircraft, still being the only airline in the world to operate the type.Not many European airlines have expressed any interest in the C919, although Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has been clear it's not ruled out.Although China is rightfully proud of its advancements in aviation over recent years, it has done so with extensive support from the West.The engines for the C919 were made by CFM International, a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines. Western-based companies, including the tire company Michelin, Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and others, have supplied other parts for the aircraft.With this collaboration working at present, the geopolitical situation is tense. This leaves a risk that the supply of these components could be cut off to COMAC should things worsen in the future.According to a supplement to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 15, the US has identified several hundred China-based entities that require specific licenses for US-based businesses to sell items to.While that does not include COMAC just yet, an escalating conflict in Ukraine – with the US already sanctioning Chinese companies for aiding Russia’s war effort in its illegal invasion of Ukraine – or in Taiwan could result in a sudden shortage of parts for the manufacturer of the new narrowbody.","Comac C919 Avrupa Birliği'nde sertifikasyona yaklaşıyor. AB Hava Güvenlik Dairesi (EASA) COMAC'ın Çin'in başkenti Şangay'daki tesislerini ziyaret etti. Ziyarette, Çin'de inşa edilen Airbus A320neo ve Boeing 737 Max rakipinin tam uçuş simulyatörünün oturumu da yer aldı.

Air Force Two Envy: Vance Stalks Harris At Wisconsin Airport To See His Future Plane,"Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, JD Vance, had an interesting run-in with incumbent vice president Kamala Harris at a Wisconsin airport. Vance walked across the apron to speak with reporters in front of Air Force Two, noting that the plane would be at his disposal in a few months. As you would expect, media coverage of the incident has been polarized - some, including MSNBC, labeled it as ""cringe"" and suggested the move was threatening towards women.","Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, JD Vance, had an interesting run-in with incumbent vice president Kamala Harris at a Wisconsin airport as their respective arrivals overlapped. Vance walked across the apron to speak with reporters in front of Air Force Two, noting that the plane would be at his disposal in a few months.On Wednesday, Harris and her VP nominee, Tim Walz, along with Vance, were in Wisconsin to campaign ahead of the US Presidential election in November. Perhaps by coincidence, or perhaps not, their two planes would arrive at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport (EAU) near Eau Claire, Wisconsin, within minutes of each other.Vance capitalized on the run-in by walking over to Harris' Air Force Two jet and addressing a scrum of waiting reporters. As Vance approached, he was heard saying, ""I just wanted to check out my future plane,"" alluding to the fact that a Republican victory in November would put Air Force Two at his disposal.Vance then stated that the reason he came over was to personally ask Kamala Harris why she is so reluctant to speak to members of the media. The VP nominee remarked that Harris had not taken any questions from reporters for 17 days, adding,""I thought the press gaggle following her would get a little lonely. I at least have enough respect for you, and the American people you report to, to come and talk to you.""He signed off by quipping that he hoped his opponent would ""run a real campaign"" instead of relying on teleprompters, adding that it was ""disgraceful"" she avoided media questions. As you would expect, media coverage of the incident has been polarized - some, including MSNBC, labeled it as ""cringe"" and suggested the move was threatening towards women, while conservative outlets hailed it as a viral moment.Harris and Walz held a campaign rally near Eau Claire on Wednesday, attended by approximately 12,000 supporters. Wisconsin is a key battleground state that has been won by a margin of less than 1% in recent elections. During his visit, Vance visited a facility run by aviation ground support equipment (GSE) manufacturer Wollard International.Everyone knows about Air Force One, the aircraft(s) responsible for flying the US President and his entourage around. However, Air Force Two gets far less coverage - the callsign 'Air Force Two' designates any United States Air Force (USAF) plane transporting the Vice President of the United States.Looking at the unique capabilities of this VIP transport.This duty is currently handled by a Boeing C-32A, which is a modified variant of the Boeing 757-200 - the plane has been in service since 1998 and a total of four airframes were built. It's not only the Vice President that flies on the C-32A, with the plane also used to transport the First Lady, Secretary of State and sometimes other high-ranking officials.","Donald Trump'un cumhurbaşkan yardımcısı JD Vance, Wisconsin havaalanında görevdeki cumhurbaşkan yardımcısı Kamala Harris ile ilginç bir yarış yaptı.

4 American Airlines Flight Attendants Injured After Airbus A321 Hit Turbulence,"American Airlines Flight 2905 experienced unexpected turbulence on June 8th. Four cabin crew members were injured, but no other injuries were reported. There has been a marked increase in turbulence-related injuries in recent years. The scientific community agrees that climate change and global warming are exacerbating turbulence and that passengers should expect air travel to become more bumpy.","American Airlines Flight 2905 on June 8th was eventful but for the wrong reasons. Unexpected turbulence injured four cabin crew members, but no other injuries were reported.American Airlines Flight 2905 is a nonstop flight using an Airbus A321 twinjet from Tampa International Airport (TPA) to Charlotte Douglas International (CLT). According to local news outlet WBTV, the jet experienced unexpected turbulence along the aircraft's 547-mile flight path, resulting in all four cabin crew members sustaining injuries.The severity of the injuries is unknown at this point. However, after the aircraft landed safely at its destination airport, the crewmembers were transported to a local hospital for further evaluation. Simple Flying has contacted American Airlines to find out how they're doing and will update this page if a response is received.Onboard the flight were 154 passengers and six crew; thankfully, no other injuries were reported. The two remaining crew members were the flight crew, who are always strapped in while at their station.American Airlines released the following statement:""American Airlines flight 2905 with service from Tampa (TPA) to Charlotte (CLT) landed safely at CLT after encountering unexpected turbulence. We thank our crew members for their professionalism and our customers for their understanding.""The turbulence likely was clear air turbulence that weather radar cannot detect. CAT can only be avoided if other aircraft report it.Recent incidents have led many to become concerned over the phenomenon.According to FlightAware's Misery Map, CLT suffered some of the US's highest flight delay and cancelation rates on Thursday due to Tropical Storm Debby. More than 715 flights were delayed, and at least 22 were canceled.CLT was directly within the storm's path; other airports in the East Coast cities, such as New York, Miami, and Washington DC, also faced delays.It seems there has been a marked increase in turbulence-related injuries in recent years, although some would argue it's simply getting more media attention. But the numbers don't lie, and studies done by the University of Reading in the UK into transatlantic turbulence events found severe turbulence increased by 55% between 1979 and 2020.Notable recent events where people have been injured during turbulence include Air Europa Flight 45, Qatar Airways Flight 17, and Singapore Airlines Flight 321 - which resulted in the death of a passenger.The scientific community agrees that climate change and global warming are exacerbating turbulence, and that passengers should expect air travel to become more bumpy. Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading, told USA Today that more severe turbulence was expected, noting that,""If there’s three times as much turbulence in the atmosphere, that’s three times the obstacles you have to avoid as a pilot. Every time a pilot tries to go around turbulence, it adds to the workload of air traffic controllers and pilots.""Airlines are implementing policies to reduce the risk of injury. Korean Air changed its cabin service procedures, ending service 40 minutes before landing, and has stopped serving instant ramen - a crowd favorite - due to concerns over hot liquid spillage. Singapore Airlines has mandated that crew will strap in and stop service when the seatbelt sign comes on.The airline cites passenger safety as the reason for this change.Emirates became the first airline to integrate the IATA Turbulence Aware Platform with Lufthansa Systems' Lido mPilot to help better predict and avoid turbulence. The system allows aircraft to automatically share turbulence information with others on the same platform, creating a network of information to help pilots identify areas of turbulence.A review of the types and intensities of turbulence, and how airlines avoid bumpy rides.","American Airlines Flight 2905 8 Haziran'da beklenmedik bir kargaşa yaşadı.

Etihad's New Airbus A321neos Help Boost 1H Profits By 48%,"The Airbus A321neo may squeeze into that category, particularly when the A321XLR starts operating long-haul routes that were previously the domain of gas-guzzling widebody jets. Etihad Airways has announced an excellent start to 2024, posting significant gains in passengers and cargo carried, revenue generated and profits earned.","Living in Australia means most people immediately link Middle Eastern carrier Etihad Airways with a luxurious widebody aircraft containing a sumptuous apartment up the front for Nicole Kidman. However, yesterday, the airline's CEO specifically mentioned the performance of the Airbus A321neo when announcing that profits had jumped by 48% in the first half of this year.Gamechanger is a word used far too often in aviation, but most would probably agree the Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet deserves that moniker, but how many others have actually changed the way we travel? Given time, the Airbus A321neo may squeeze into that category, particularly when the A321XLR starts operating long-haul routes that were previously the domain of gas-guzzling widebody jets.Back to today, Etihad Airways has announced an excellent start to 2024, posting significant gains in passengers and cargo carried, revenue generated and profits earned compared to the first half of 2023. In the first six months of 2024 (1H24), Etihad carried 8.7 million passengers, generated total revenues of AED 11.7 billion ($3.2b) and earned profits of AED 851 million ($230m), achieving year-on-year (YoY) gains of 38%, 21% and 48%, respectively.A striking new design to usher in 20 years of flying.Figures from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported an average passenger growth rate of 13% for Middle Eastern carriers in the first half, a gain dwarfed by Etihad's 38% increase in 1H24. The gain came from meeting strong demand fueled by strategic network expansion, increased frequencies and the arrival of Airbus A321neos.Etihad Aviation Group CEO Antonoaldo Neves said the 48% profit increase reflected a robust performance in both passenger and cargo revenues, demonstrating the soundness of the Group's strategy and growth path. He noted that notwithstanding global aircraft shortages, Etihad had 16 more aircraft in its fleet of 92 than at the same time last year, including three Airbus A321neos, adding:""We are bringing six A321neos into operation this year, equipped with advanced CFM LEAP 1A engines. In the next 18 months we expect to add more than 20 new generation aircraft to our fleet, which offer reduced emissions and up to 20% more efficiency compared to previous models.""Having more aircraft is one thing, but finding profitable routes for them to fly on is often tricky. Etihad optimized its network in the first half by increasing frequencies on existing, successful routes and adding eleven new destinations. The new routes from Abu Dhabi's Zayed International Airport (AUH) include Thiruvananthapuram, Kozhikode and Jaipur in India, Al Qassim in Saudi Arabia, Boston in the US and Bali in Indonesia.The new system has been activated on 10 of the airline's 28 Airbus A320 family aircraft.Etihad also resumed seasonal routes to Nice (France), Antalya (Turkey), Malaga (Spain), Mykonos and Santorini in Greece. The airline also signed a landmark joint venture with China Eastern Airlines, marking the first commercial agreement of its kind between a Middle Eastern and a Chinese airline.In 1H24, Etihad generated revenue of AED 11.7 billion ($3.2b), comprising AED 9.8 billion ($2.7b) from passenger and AED 1.9 billion ($0.5b) from cargo operations. It made an operating profit of AED 1.0 billion ($270m) and a profit after tax of AED 851 million ($230m). It had an operating fleet of 92 aircraft, including five freighters, compared to 76 in 1H23 and operated 42,000 landings, 31% more than in the first half of last year.","Airbus A321neo, özellikle A321XLR'nin daha önce doğalgaz sevkıyat eden geniş uçağın alanı olan uzun mesafeli seferleri başlattığında bu kategoriye girebilir.

The carrier's in-house investigation revealed the theft, and the accused was found in possession of the stolen vouchers.A man working as a customer service agent for Southwest Airlines was charged by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office for stealing flight vouchers. The theft was revealed after Southwest conducted an in-house investigation between August 1 and September 28, tracing it to an employee named Brooklyn Jones.According to reports, Jones confessed to the crime and agreed to surrender the vouchers he had printed; he had been using the names of previous passengers and then redeeming the vouchers himself. When he was taken to his St. Louis Lambert International Airport locker, police found 119 travel vouchers worth $36,000.Jones revealed that nobody had taught him how to produce the vouchers and said no one else had been involved in such an activity at St. Louis airport. He admitted to producing $79,000 worth of flight vouchers. Simple Flying has contacted Southwest Airlines for a statement and will update the article when we receive a response.This isn’t the first time something like this has happened with Southwest Airlines. In 2023, it was revealed that one of the carrier’s employees, DaJuan Martin from Bolingbrook, Illinois, was arrested for making and selling travel vouchers worth nearly $1.9 million.Martin worked at Chicago's Midway International Airport (MDW) and produced these vouchers using fake names, which he then sold to others at less than face value. He, too, was a customer service agent for Southwest from November 2018 to June 2022 and had the authority to issue vouchers for customers who experienced delays and cancelations.Over the years, several workers employed by airlines, airports, and third-party agencies have been involved in thefts and arrested. In 2022, a Spirit Airlines baggage handler was arrested for stealing items from checked-in luggage.Cush Vengeto worked for the carrier at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and was caught after an investigation following several complaints from passengers about items missing from their luggage.In 2023, three TSA agents employed at the Miami International Airport (MIA) were arrested for fraud and grand theft following a passenger's complaint. The crime was caught on surveillance camera, with the footage revealing the TSA workers going through passengers' bags at checkpoint E. The accused were seen putting items in their pockets after reaching into the bags.In October 2023, seven baggage handlers at New Delhi airport were arrested after it was found that they stole several items, including gold, luxury watches, AirPods, and foreign currency. The arrest took place after Delhi police put in place a special investigation team following reports of baggage thefts in the preceding months.","Southwest Airlines'ın müşteri servisi ajanı olarak çalışan bir adam, St. Louis County Savcılığı tarafından uçuş kuponlarını çalmakla suçlandı.

Archer Aviation Announces Los Angeles eVTOL Netowork Ahead Of The World Cup & Olympics,"Archer Aviation has unveiled a route network for its electric air taxis in Los Angeles. The company did so ahead of several major sporting events in the area in the coming years. The goal is to change how Southern California residents and visitors commute, travel, and spend their free time. Archer is already in talks with the University of Southern California to join its network.","Archer Aviation has unveiled a route network for its electric air taxis in Los Angeles. The company did so ahead of several major sporting events in the area in the coming years, promising faster transfer times between key locations and less time sat in traffic.Founded in 2018, Archer Aviation is developing electric air taxis to reduce time spent in vehicles. The company is working with the Federal Aviation Administration and other aviation authorities worldwide to ensure all regulations are followed. Today, Archer unveiled its route network, hoping to begin operations as early as 2026.As one of its focus cities, Archer has laid out its plans for LA. The city is set to host several major sporting events in the coming years, including the FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympic Games, so Archer hopes to have its network up and running. The goal is to change how Southern California residents and visitors commute, travel, and spend their free time.In today’s announcement, Archer announced that it plans to operate at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Long Beach Airport (LGB), John Wayne Airport (SNA), Santa Monica Airport, and Hollywood-Burbank International Airport (BUR). With these locations in mind, Archer hopes to reduce one- to two-hour drives to a 10-20-minute flight. But Archer plans to expand beyond airports.The company is already in talks with the University of Southern California (USC) near downtown LA to join its network. In the coming years, the two parties will evaluate the possibility of using the university’s existing heliports for electric taxi operations.“This is a big moment for Archer. Establishing our LA network ahead of the global events that are coming to the region over the next three years is a milestone that will put Midnight on display for the whole world to see. LA is known for its horrendous traffic—our goal is to offer a safer, faster and sustainable alternative travel option.” - Adam Goldstein, Chief Executive Officer, Archer AviationArcher is also working with the Los Angeles Rams, one of the two American football teams in the LA area, to place heliports at the team’s practice facility and the SoFi Stadium. Both locations are near airports, with the practice facility in Woodland Hills near the Van Nuys Airport and the stadium between the landing paths for runways 25L and 24R at LAX.The LA network follows Archer's earlier this year reveal of plans for a network in San Francisco. Two more launch cities—New York and Miami—have not yet had networks revealed.Air taxis could be in service as soon as next year.In addition to announcing its network today, Archer revealed that it had reached an agreement in principle with Stellantis for a significant amount of funding. Stellantis is an automobile manufacturing company formed in the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA. In addition to previous investments, Stellantis will contribute up to $400 million to help Archer reach a manufacturing rate of 650 annually.Speaking on Archer’s strong second quarter, Goldstein added,“…we are working tirelessly to enable commercial operations all over the world. Our indicative order book now sits at nearly $6B. With the additional funding and planned LA network we announced today, Archer is well positioned to meet our goal of commercialization as early as next year.”",Archer Aviation Los Angeles'te elektrikli hava taksileri için bir rota ağını hizmete soktu.

Mobile Lounges: The Forgotten Way Of Getting Passengers Onto Planes,Mobile lounges first entered service at Washington Dulles International Airport in 1962. These vehicles are much like the transfer buses that we know and love (to hate) today. They can be raised and connected to an aircraft like a jetbridge. The concept was cooked up by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen.,"Boarding an aircraft is a process that we are all familiar with, whether it is done via a jetbridge or external stairs from the apron. For the latter method, passengers are often required to take a bus transfer to a remote stand, where boarding via stairs occurs.However, another method of boarding an aircraft exists, known as mobile lounges. These little-known vehicles serve as something of a halfway house between jetbridges and stairs, but they fell out of fashion decades ago. That said, you can still find them at a select few airports.The 1960s were an exciting time when it came to innovation in the world of aviation. For example, this was the decade when the legendary Anglo-French supersonic jetliner Concorde made its first flight (although it didn't enter service until the 1970s).But back on the ground, further innovation was occurring. This came in the form of mobile lounges, which first entered service at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) in 1962. As seen in the photograph below, these vehicles are much like the transfer buses that we know and love (to hate) today, but they can be raised and connected to an aircraft like a jetbridge.This meant that passengers boarding aircraft at remote stands didn't have to be exposed to the elements, letting them walk straight onto the aircraft much like a jetbridge. The concept was cooked up by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, who wanted to make life easier for passengers when shuttling them from the main terminal, which he also designed.Get the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: 
Sign up for our newsletters today.More than 100 passengers can be accommodated in each of the mobile lounges, with 71 seated and another 31 standing. These vehicles are 16.46 meters (54 feet) long, 4.88 meters (16 feet) wide, and 5.33 meters (17.5 feet) tall. According to Atlas Obscura, they can travel at a reasonable pace too, reaching 26 mph (42 km/h).While Washington Dulles Airport initially used its mobile lounges to transport passengers to individual aircraft, their function changed over the years. Indeed, the advent of jetbridges and satellite concourses rendered them less useful in this regard, so they were redesignated for inter-concourse transport instead.As it happens, Washington Dulles was not the only airport to use such vehicles over the years. Indeed, they have also seen use at Montréal's Trudeau (YUL) and Mirabel (YMX) airports, as well as the likes of New York JFK (JFK) and Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). NASA even used similar, albeit modified, vehicles to transport its astronauts around.At Washington Dulles, the mobile lounge is set to stay for the foreseeable future after the airport decided to invest in its refurbishment last year. Although the airport invested over $1 billion into its AeroTrain system, its mobile lounges will benefit from a $143 investment to bring them up to modern standards. Design firm Brookville Equipment Corporation will initially upgrade two vehicles before getting to work on the airport's entire fleet.The vintage mobile lounges will be given a new lease of life to transport passengers to and from the airport's Concourse D.Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is also another user of mobile lounges, or what it terms PTVs (Passenger Transfer Vehicles). These vehicles are primarily called up when no gates are available, but PHL is not as reliant upon them as Washington Dulles with just six vehicles at its disposal.According to the airport, each PTV is 60 feet long and weighs 76,000 lbs (38 tons), with a capacity for over 100 passengers. As explained by PHL Deputy Director of Facilities Maintenance Allan Moore,""Our PTVs are another tool to accommodate our guests in the event of gate unavailability or emergency situations so they can continue their journeys.""Want answers to more key questions in aviation?

!One of the main downsides of mobile lounges is their operating cost. They are rather bulky machines that need costly fuel, and also require more maintenance than jetbridges or external stairs. Speaking of maintenance, because the vehicles are so dated, it has become very difficult to source the correct spare parts for them, only adding to the cost of keeping them operational.The current system of using bridges is also a quicker way of getting passengers onto the plane, allowing for a more efficient boarding process. This also allows passengers to gradually stream their way onto an aircraft, rather than a large block of passengers arriving at once and forming a long queue.As much as mobile lounges were once seen as the future of airport infrastructure, they are now essentially a fun, novel way for passengers to travel between concourses. However, their recent safety record hasn't been perfect. Indeed, USA Today reported in October 2016 that two passengers had been hospitalized after one of the vehicles crashed into a construction trench at Washington Dulles International Airport.Two more passengers required hospital treatment in March 2022 after an incident at the same airport. In this instance, the vehicle's rear wheel collided with a jersey wall. Another 12 passengers were evaluated for potential injuries at the scene but didn't need to be transported to the hospital.","Mobil salonlar ilk olarak 1962 yılında Washington Dulles Uluslararası Havaalanı'nda hizmete girdiler.

Iran-Israel Conflict: More Airspace Closures In Middle East Lead To Shifting Routes,"Britain and Egypt asked their airlines to avoid flying over Lebanon and Iran on Thursday, August 8. Iran had sent a cautionary notice asking Egypt to avoid the country's airspace between 04:30 and 07:30 local time. Singapore Airlines began avoiding flying over Iran last week, noting that it was monitoring the situation in the Middle East.","As tensions in the Middle East continue to grow, some airlines have been forced to avoid Iranian and Lebanese airspaces as a cautionary measure. Meanwhile, several international carriers have suspended flights to Israel again.Amid fears of a wider regional conflict, Britain and Egypt asked their airlines to avoid flying over Lebanon and Iran on Thursday, August 8. The British advisory came after Egypt instructed its carriers to avoid flying over Iran for up to three hours on Thursday morning.Although the country's major carriers, including Egyptair, have already been avoiding Iran, the directive applied to all operators, including charters and smaller airlines. A NOTAM issued by Egyptian authorities said the instruction would be effective from 01:00 to 04:00 GMT.""All Egyptian carriers shall avoid overflying Tehran (Flight Information Region). No flight plan will be accepted overflying such territory.""According to Firstpost, Tehran had sent a cautionary notice asking Egypt to avoid the country's airspace between 04:30 and 07:30 local time. Reuters reported that a statement from the ministry came after state-affiliated news outlet Al Qahera News TV quoted an unnamed source saying that Iranian authorities had issued a notice to avoid the country's airspace due to ""military exercises.""According to the Iranian Foreign Ministry's website, the country's acting Foreign Minister, Ali Bagheri Kani, spoke to his Egyptian counterpart over the phone on Wednesday, August 7.Until Iran's new Su-35s arrive, it is left with a few dozen out of date or obsolete operational fighter jets.The escalating tensions in the Middle East come after the July 31 killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran as well as senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut. Following the directive, several flights were rerouted to avoid Iranian and Lebanese airspace, while some airlines suspended flights to Israel and Lebanon.Last week, Singapore Airlines began avoiding flying over Iran, noting that it was monitoring the situation in the Middle East. For example, its flights from Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) to Istanbul (IST), which previously flew over Iran, are now following routes over Afghanistan and Turkmenistan.Since October 2023, flights to and from Israel have been significantly disrupted due to security and political factors. Many airlines suspended flights for extended periods, while others pulled out indefinitely. Amid the latest security concerns, major carriers have once again suspended flights to Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport , the country's main gateway.Lufthansa, along with its subsidiaries Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, and Eurowings, had initially suspended flights until August 8, but that has been extended to August 13. The suspension also includes flights to Beirut, Tehran, Amman, and Erbil.Similarly, US carriers, which recently reinstated connections to Israel , have once again suspended their services. Delta Air Lines has paused flights between New York JFK and Tel Aviv for the rest of August. The airline is ""continuously monitoring the evolving security environment"" and assessing its operations based on security guidance. Meanwhile, United Airlines flights also remain suspended. Other airlines that have halted flights to Israel include flydubai, Iberia, Wizz Air, Ryanair, and KLM.","İngiltere ve Mısır, 8 Ağustos Perşembe günü havayollarından Lübnan ve İran'ı geçmekten kaçınmalarını istediler.

Boeing’s New CEO Begins His Tenure As Company Reels From 2 Days Of NTSB Hearings,"Kelly Ortberg, the new president and chief executive officer of Boeing, began his tenure on August 8. Ortberg replaced David Calhoun, who has remained at the company as a board member. The Boeing executive's statements related to the Alaska Airlines incident have resulted in sanctions by the NTSB. The latest downward spiral began after an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 lost its mid-exit door plug as it was climbing out of Portland International Airport in January.","While the two events were unrelated, Kelly Ortberg, the new president and chief executive officer of Boeing, began his tenure just as the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) ended its two-day hearings related to the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug blowout, which has sent the aircraft manufacturer into its latest crisis.Ortberg, who replaced David Calhoun, who has remained at the company as a board member, began his tenure as the plane maker's chief executive on August 8.In a publicly published letter, Ortberg remarked that he was proud and excited to join Boeing, immediately admitting that the company has a lot of work to do to restore trust in the company.However, he was confident that by working together, the company's employees would restore the manufacturer’s status as the industry leader.“Restoring trust starts with meeting our commitments – whether that’s building high quality, safe commercial aircraft, delivering on defense and space products that allow our customers to meet their mission, or servicing our products to keep our customers running 24/7.”Ortberg added that this also meant that Boeing’s employees had to meet their commitments to each other and work collaboratively to achieve the company’s goals.Boeing's work is complex, and the new CEO believed the company had to get closer to the production lines and development programs. The executive planned to be based in Seattle, where Boeing’s main assembly lines are located.On August 8, Ortberg visited the Renton assembly line, where Boeing takes deliveries of various 737 components and assembles the final aircraft before its delivery to customers. He said he would also review its safety and quality plans there and added that he would be visiting other sites “soon.”“In speaking with our customers and industry partners leading up to today, I can tell you that without exception, everyone wants us to succeed. In many cases, they NEED us to succeed. This is a great foundation for us to build upon.”Ex-Rockwell Collins leader, Kelly Ortberg, has been picked for the top job.Ortberg promised to be transparent with the company’s employees, sharing news as Boeing progressed with its planned safety and quality improvements, as well as any future plans.Citing his three-decade career in aerospace, the new CEO stated that he had been impressed by Boeing’s employees, adding that the company has what it takes to win, and he was committed to working with everyone to ensure that everybody was proud of being part of Boeing.Ortberg replaced Calhoun as the company entered another crisis several years after the 737 MAX groundings.The latest downward spiral began after an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 lost its mid-exit door plug as it was climbing out of Portland International Airport (PDX) in January.While the aircraft returned to PDX after the door plug, which was later found in a backyard in Portland, with several injuries onboard, airlines and regulators have begun scrutinizing Boeing and its manufacturing processes.The Boeing executive's statements related to the Alaska Airlines incident have resulted in sanctions by the NTSB.Calhoun himself replaced Dennis Muilenburg in December 2019, as the plane maker struggled to contain the fallout of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which resulted in regulators grounding the type gradually across the world in March 2019.The FAA eventually ungrounded the type in December 2020, and in January 2021, Boeing and the Department of Justice (DOJ) entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA).In May, the DOJ found that the aircraft manufacturer had violated the DPA. The two sides finalized a plea deal in July, with Boeing agreeing to pay $243.6 million.At the time, the DOJ stated that the company broke the terms of the DPA by failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect further violations of US fraud laws.The DOJ and Boeing have asked the court to accept the plea agreement consistent with standard practice of the United States Government.Unlike during the 737 MAX groundings in 2019, the reactions following the 737 MAX 9 door plug blowout were swift. While initially, airlines in the US voluntarily grounded their fleets of the type, the FAA followed suit, restricting carriers from operating the 737 MAX 9 commercially on January 6, a day after the Alaska Airlines incident.Not every 737 MAX 9 has a door plug, and operators are mandated to fit emergency exits if they design their 737 MAX 9 with more seats on the type. On the 737 MAX 9 involved in the incident, which the airline returned to Boeing, the airline fitted 178 seats.While the US regulator ungrounded the type shortly after, the FAA stated that it would prohibit Boeing from raising the monthly production rate while also giving the aircraft manufacturer 90 days to develop a comprehensive safety and quality improvement plan.The NTSB issued its preliminary incident report on February 6, determining that the bolts that were supposed to retain the door plug were missing. However, the investigators will provide the incident's contributing factors and probable cause(s) with the final report.As part of its investigation, the agency visited Spirit AeroSystem's headquarters in Wichita, Kansas.Nevertheless, Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems , which supplies the manufacturer with the fuselages that included the defective fuselage whose door plug had to be opened up during the assembly process, FAA, and other stakeholders were involved in two-day hearings in Washington, DC, the US on August 6 and August 7.During the hearings, Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems’ working cultures were scrutinized, as well as how the two companies ensure quality and safety assurance during the production of their products, including the 737. The two companies announced a definitive agreement for the former to acquire the latter in July.Before the two-day event, the NTSB sanctioned Boeing and the company lost access to any new information from the investigation into the incident for disclosing non-public information at a media event at its facilities.The two-day hearings will continue on August 7, with the NTSB continuing to interrogate Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, FAA, and other stakeholders.","Boeing'un yeni başkanı ve genel müdürü Kelly Ortberg 8 Ağustos'ta göreve başladı. Ortberg, şirketin yönetim kurulu üyesi olarak görevde kalmayı sürdüren David Calhoun'un yerini aldı. Boeing'un Alaska Airlines olayıyla ilgili açıklamaları NTSB tarafından yaptırımlara yol açtı. En son düşüş dalgası, Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9'un Ocak ayında Portland Uluslararası Havaalanı'ndan çıkmak üzere çıkış kapısının yarısını kaybettikten sonra başladı.",https://simpleflying.com/boeing-ceo-begins-tenure/,https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/boeing-logo-on-a-737-max-shutterstock_1591001176.jpg
United Airlines Will Stop Printing Hemispheres Magazines After 32 Years,"Hemispheres was first produced in 1992 and, since 2009, has been published each month by Ink, one of the world's leading travel media publishers. United Airlines will move the publication over to a digital format and embrace the opportunities brought by the use of technology. A preview of the digital version is already available on the carrier's website.","United Airlines has announced that it will discontinue the publication of its monthly inflight magazine, Hemispheres, with September 2024 being the final printed edition. After more than 30 years, the carrier plans to move Hemispheres' content to a new digital version.For many, Hemispheres set United Airlines apart from its rivals. However, most other US carriers, including the rest of the US Big 3, had already eliminated hemispheres. Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines dropped their inflight magazines during the pandemic, while American Airlines held out until 2021 to end the publication of American Way.Environmental reasons are likely to have played a part in the carrier's decision, with a reduction in paper use and the distribution of printed magazines. When looking at scale, printed magazines are also heavy, which is why several years ago, United Airlines began printing Hemispheres on a lighter type of paper, saving around 170,000 gallons of fuel per year - equivalent to around $290,000. By going digital, the carrier removes any additional weight and the associated fuel costs, which is a huge benefit both financially and environmentally.Airbus spoke to Simple Flying about hydrogen-powered aircraft, the A380, and its yearly $2 billion investment in sustainable innovations.The pandemic also made passengers more wary of touching contaminated surfaces when traveling, and the idea of reading a magazine already read by hundreds of other people is, for some, perhaps not as appealing as it once was.Moving Hemispheres to a digital version also ties in with the wider trend of airlines offering streaming services to keep passengers entertained instead. Nowadays, many passengers travel with a personal device on which they can watch TV shows and films or listen to music to pass the time.Hemispheres was first produced in 1992 and, since 2009, has been published each month by Ink, one of the world's leading travel media publishers. One of the magazine's regular travel features, titled 'Three Perfect Days,' proved particularly popular with flyers, developing almost a cult following among those looking for travel inspiration for their next trip.Recent Hemispheres articles have included:In addition to helping flyers pass the time, Hemispheres was also a huge source of revenue for United Airlines. According to Modern Retail, a full-page advertising spread in Hemispheres has been known to set retailers back up to $115,000.However, all is not lost for Hemisphere fans, as United Airlines will move the publication over to a digital format and embrace the opportunities brought by the use of technology. In a statement published by Modern Retail, a spokesperson for United Airlines said,“A digital experience allows us to make Hemispheres even better — we can reach a wider audience, offer more personalized content and tell richer stories. We’ve even hired additional United staff to help us bring this new vision to life. We’re excited about the future possibilities and look forward to sharing more details soon.”A preview of the digital version is already available on the carrier's website.United Airlines sold its TriStars after only flying them for a short time.",Hemispheres ilk olarak 1992 yılında üretildi ve 2009 yılından bu yana dünyanın önde gelen seyahat medya yayıncılarından biri olan Ink tarafından her ay basılıyor.

"Over 2,600 Nautical Miles: flydubai Begins Its New Longest European Route","On August 2, flydubai began what is for now its longest European route. It is from Dubai – where else? – to Basel. At 2,619 nautical miles (4,851 km) each way, the new route about passes the distance threshold I use to denote long-haul.","On August 2, flydubai began what is for now its longest European route. It is from Dubai – where else? – to Basel. The airport is officially called EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg (what a mouthful!) due to its highly unusual geographic position. The Swiss and the French run it, and it is one of the few airports run by two countries. Strangely, the new route’s celebration did not take place for five days after the first flight, hence only appearing in passing in my jam-packed weekly new routes article.At 2,619 nautical miles (4,851 km) each way, the new route about passes the distance threshold I use to denote long-haul. But do not fret: the operating 174-seat Boeing 737 MAX 8 is equipped with 10 lie-flat beds. That provides a reminder, if needed, that the airline is not a low-cost carrier.The new route, operated on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays, is currently scheduled as follows, with all times local. Notice the 7h 10m maximum block or scheduled time to Europe.Want tickets? Get them here!It is flydubai's first time in Switzerland. It joins Emirates' double daily flights to Zurich (A380 and 777-300ER) and Geneva (777-300ER).Basel flights go from Dubai's Terminal 3, which is good as it means easy onward connectivity to Emirates flights. Of course, the route would not exist without this connectivity. In 2023, the Basel-Dubai point-to-point market only had around 12,000 roundtrip passengers (15 passengers daily each way), although it will easily double.Basel flights leave Dubai during its big sibling's main bank of Europe-bound departures to drive connectivity. However, its 22:05 arrival time in the UAE is a bit early, with most Emirates flights landing from 23:00.Still, Basel has not had a connection option in the Gulf until now. Many Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Eastern/Southern African passengers connected in Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. The carrier serves Basel double daily.

Air Canada Blames Paris Olympics On Decreased Profits,Air Canada announced its financial performance results for the second quarter (Q2) of 2024 and noted weaker profits compared to those of 2023. The airline cited lower numbers this time around due to stagnant travel demand and a reduction in sales within the airline's European network due to events such as the Olympics. Air Canada is in the process of expanding its route network and adding capacity to its fleet.,"Air Canada announced its financial performance results for the second quarter (Q2) of 2024 and noted weaker profits compared to those of 2023. The airline cited lower numbers this time around due to stagnant travel demand and a reduction in sales within the airline's European network due to events such as the Olympics.Yesterday, Air Canada reported its earnings for Q2 2024, during which the airline made a profit of $339 million from its revenue of $4 billion. However, compared to data from Q2 2023, the airline's profits decreased this year.Q2 2024Q2 2023ChangeRevenue ($ million)4,0143,947+1.6 %Profit ($ million)339583-42 %Operating Margin (%)8.414.8-43.2 %While it is reported that the general passenger demand has stagnated, Quartz also reported that Air Canada considers the Paris Olympics to have a negative impact on the airline's profits. Reports suggest that potential customers who would not be interested in attending the Olympics in person are avoiding Paris because of all the rush in and around the city associated with the event.While business/corporate travel will not be impacted much, other segments of travelers, such as VFR (Visiting Friends and Relatives), will be severely impacted, as passengers would not prefer to fly during this time due to high ticket fares and hotel fares in and around Paris being expensive due to the Olympics.Furthermore, the airline also stated that prior to the Olympics, the Euro Tournament, which took place in Germany, also resulted in various segments of tourists avoiding flying to Germany during that period.Simple Flying has reached out to Air Canada to know what their forecast is for the next two quarters of the year. Any response received will be updated into the article.The financial hit by tourists avoiding Paris due to the Olympics is affecting not only Air Canada but other airlines as well. The US-based giant Delta Air Lines, earlier this month, reported that the airline expects to lose around $100 million this summer due to the Olympics, citing tourists not wishing to fly to France.Tourists are shying away from the City Of Lights this month as travelers typically headed to Paris postpone their trips till after the Games.Across the Atlantic, Delta's European partner, Air France, is also expecting their revenue to drop by $172 million to $194 million.Meanwhile, other carriers, such as Emirates, have already issued travel advisories for passengers looking to travel to Paris:""Due to the Summer Olympics 2024 and Paralympic games 2024 in Paris, roads in the city will be congested. Some areas around the Olympic village and sport facilities will have restricted access.""The airline also advises its customers to access the relevant website to ensure they can gain access to their destination within the Paris area.Despite the reduced profits and lower profit margin, Air Canada is in the process of expanding its route network and adding capacity to its fleet.Just a month ago, the airline acquired eight new Boeing 737 MAX 8s on lease from BOC Aviation, which will be delivered to the carrier throughout the next five months, increasing the carrier's capacity and operational flexibility.All eight jets will be delivered this year and enter into service in 2025.As part of the airline's network expansion, Air Canada has already announced that it will be adding over 50 services to popular sunny destinations across the US and the Caribbean region for its winter schedule.","Air Canada, 2024'ün ikinci çeyreğinde (Q2) mali performansı sonuçlarını açıkladı ve 2023 yılına oranla daha zayıf kârlar kaydetti.

Thus, its revolving credit facilities now total $1.5 billion.Notably, LATAM Airlines ended Q2 with a liquidity position of $3 billion, with its cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.8 billion.The airline group's shares were delisted in June 2020 as it underwent Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.","LATAM Havayolları yıllık bazda (YYılda) kapasitesini artırmaya devam ederek gelirlerini artırmasına karşın üç aylık kârı azaldı.
