Why US Airports' ICAO Codes Start With The Letter K,"Have you ever wondered why all airports have a three-letter code, such as LAX for Los Angeles International Airport or JFK for New York John F. Kennedy International Airport? These three-letter codes, known as airport identifiers, are designated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and are easily visible to passengers on their airline tickets, boarding passes, and luggage tags.On the other hand, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) also designates airports with a four-letter code, identifying airports and landing strips. The additional letter generally consists of a country or a region prefix. This article delves deeper into the meaning of these codes and how all airports in the US have the letter ""K"" in the prefixes, as described by ICAO and IATA.Airport codes vary significantly around the globe.In the US, the ICAO codes of most airports are simply their IATA code (think 'ORD' or 'MIA') with the prefix 'K' ('KORD' or KMIA'). The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) assigned the prefix ' K' to the US as it wanted these prefixes to reflect the geographical location of each airport or airstrip. Other prefixes include:The image above highlights how ICAO prefixes depend on the geographical location of the airport.The 'K' prefix was only reserved for the contiguous United States (all states from California to Maine and Washington to Florida, but not Hawaii and Alaska). Hawaii and Alaska use the 'P' prefix, more commonly used in the South Pacific islands. However, unlike the continental United States, which simply adds the K prefix to the IATA airport code, each country, state, or region that uses the 'P' prefix is assigned a second letter.For example, Hawaii is assigned 'H,' and so all ICAO codes within the state of Hawaii begin with 'PH.' Alaskan airports are instead given the prefix 'PA.' Honolulu (IATA: HNL) and Kahului (IATA: OGG) are, therefore, PHNL and PHOG, respectively. Alaskan Airports Anchorage (IATA: ANC) and Fairbanks (IATA: FAI) are PANC and PAFA.IATA airport codes are used by commercial airlines in their operations and are assigned by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). They initially established these airport codes to facilitate international travel. More recently, IATA has started issuing codes to bus and ferry terminals, as well as train stations, to allow for better connections between these modes of transport.ICAO airport codes are generally less recognized by commercial passengers. For example, when referring to London Heathrow Airport or Hong Kong International Airport, most passengers will simply think of LHR and HKG, not EGLL and VHHH. However, for industry professionals such as air traffic controllers and pilots, these ICAO airport codes mean much more.With flight plans, for example, airports are identified by these codes. In addition, some other locations, such as weather forecast facilities and air traffic control offices, are also given ICAO codes.Speaking of IATA codes, across the northern border of the US, Canada has a distinct pattern with its system. Notably, its codes begin with the letter Y, which dates back to the 1930s when an airport had Y for ""yes"" if they had a weather/radio station at the facility. Examples of Canadian airport IATA codes include:So why do Canadian airport codes begin with the letter Y? Let’s find out.In the United States, airports that would like to be given an ICAO airport code are asked to contact the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which will then provide the relevant authorities with the contact information for the International Civil Aviation Organization.Airports then have to provide detailed information, including location, altitude, and length of runway, in order to obtain an ICAO airport code. Altogether, ICAO codes generally have a more stringent structure than their IATA counterparts.Both IATA and ICAO have assigned codes to airports. What do they mean? Why are they different?","ICAO airport codes have a four-letter structure with a geographical prefix, such as 'K' for the US.The 'K' prefix only applies to contiguous US states, excluding Hawaii and Alaska, which have their own prefix.IATA codes are more widely recognized by passengers, while ICAO codes are crucial for industry professionals.",https://simpleflying.com/why-us-airports-icao-codes-start-with-the-letter-k/,"Airport codes are assigned by the International Air Transport Association ( I ATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICA O)<n>In the US, the ICAO codes of most airports are simply their I ATA code ( think'ORD'or'MIA') with the prefix'K'('K ORD'or K MIA '.<n>The'K'prefix was only reserved for the contiguous United States ( all states from California to Maine and Washington to Florida, but not Hawaii and Alaska.<n>The'P'prefix is more commonly used in the South Pacific islands..

Air New Zealand Airbus A321neo Diverts To Auckland Following Hard Landing In Wellington,"An Air New Zealand Airbus A321neo was forced to make an emergency landing at Auckland (AKL) following an aborted landing at Wellington (WLG). The hard landing was initially mistaken for a tail strike but was actually caused by adverse weather conditions.Air New Zealand's Head of Flight Operations, Captain Hugh Pearce, confirmed to Simple Flying that the flight from Brisbane Airport (BNE) to Wellington (WLG) encountered wind shear just before touchdown, prompting a go-around and diversion to Auckland Airport (AKL).The Air New Zealand Airbus A321neo narrowbody, registered ZK-NND, was operating flight NZ272 from Brisbane Airport (BNE) in Australia to Wellington Airport (WLG) in New Zealand on September 26, 2024, when the pilots initiated a go-around after encountering what was reported as wind shear just before touchdown.The main wheels briefly touched the runway before the go-around was executed, initially leading to concerns of a possible tail strike. The aircraft later landed safely at Auckland Airport (AKL).According to Flightradar24.com, the return flight to Brisbane was canceled. The five-year-old A321neo is currently on the ground for maintenance checks. Pearce added:""An inspection of the aircraft confirmed there was no tail contact with the runway. Aircraft data has also been sent to Airbus to analyse and advise if there is anything else our maintenance team needs to do before the aircraft can be returned to service.""The airline stated that all passengers were re-accommodated and emphasized that, while such situations are rare, the crew is well-trained to handle them.""The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is our number one priority.""Air New Zealand said that it would issue new near-term climate reduction targets, while still sticking to its net-zero goal by 2050.The term go-around refers to an aborted landing when the decision to reject the touchdown is made on the final approach. This timescale encompasses ""any point from the final approach fix to wheels on the runway, but prior to any deceleration device being activated,"" according to SKYbrary.Go-arounds can happen for a variety of reasons, typically when current conditions are deemed unsafe for landing. Some of the most common factors include runway obstructions, adverse weather conditions, unstable approaches, congestion, or any other technical issues related to the aircraft.In recent years, there has been a troubling rise in near-misses, including a recent incident at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). In that case, two aircraft had to execute go-arounds after a Southwest Airlines plane was seen taxiing across two runways cleared for landing.In 2023, a similar situation occurred when an American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX aborted its landing at Charleston Airport (CHS) due to a JetBlue Airbus A220 on the runway, highlighting how frequent these close calls have become.This latest near miss incident forced the 737 to quickly abort its landing and perform a go around.",,https://simpleflying.com/air-new-zealand-airbus-a321neo-diverts-tail-strike/,"An Air New Zealand Airbus A 321 neo was forced to make an emergency landing at Auckland ( A KL )<n>The hard landing was initially mistaken for a tail strike but was actually caused by adverse weather conditions.<n>The aircraft later landed safely at Auckland Airport ( A KL )<n>According to Flight radar 24. com, the return flight to Brisbane was canceled.."
Slowed Aircraft Deliveries: Will Airbus Reach Its 2024 Target?,"September was slow for Airbus deliveries, increasing doubts about whether the manufacturer can meet its annual goals this year.According to a report from Reuters, Airbus has only delivered 30 aircraft this month. There are still three more days left in September, and Airbus may deliver more planes between now and Monday, but it still remains a slow month for the manufacturer. In August, Airbus delivered 47 planes to 31 customers.Reuters shared that if the current pace is kept, then Airbus will deliver about 36 planes this month. This is a significant drop from September 2023, when Airbus delivered 55 planes.So far this year, Airbus has delivered 477 planes, about 300 short of its revised annual target. With three months left in the year, the manufacturer would need to deliver an average of 100 each month to meet its goal. Previously, Airbus' goal was to deliver 800 planes in 2024, but in July, that number was lowered to 770.Industry experts are casting doubts over Airbus' ability to meet the annual target. By the end of last September, the manufacturer had delivered 488 planes, 11 more than the current year-to-date total.Get the latest aviation news straight to your inbox: 
Sign up for our newsletters today.According to Airbus, delays in deliveries of engines and other parts have slowed down the manufacturing processes. The engines specifically affect the Airbus A320 family, which is Airbus' most popular aircraft family. GE, which manufactures engines for the A320 family, has said that its output in the third quarter would be higher than in Q2.Earlier this week, Simple Flying reported that Breeze Airways was forced to push back the launch of two new routes because of delivery delays. Flights from New Orleans to Las Vegas were originally set to launch in February 2025, and service from New Orleans to Los Angeles. Now, the airline will launch the new flights in the fall.Breeze told Simple Flying,“We regret that we’ll have to delay the start of two routes: MSY – LAS (which was to launch on 2/5/25) and MSY – LAX (2/19/25) until the Fall.”With the new routes, Breeze was planning on opening a base in New Orleans in the spring of next year. The opening of the base relied on the addition of new Airbus A220s, which have been delayed. As a result, the airline now plans to launch the New Orleans base in the fall of 2025.Breeze was supposed to remove the Embraer E190s from commercial service by the end of summer. Now, the Brazilian aircraft will remain in operation into 2025.“Previously, Breeze announced that all commercial flights would be operated with A220 aircraft by Fall 2024. Given this change, the airline will still be operating Embraer aircraft on a small minority of its seats (approximately 2.8%) through next summer.”The E190s will not be officially retired until 2026, and in the meantime, will be used for charter operations.",,https://simpleflying.com/airbus-aircraft-deliveries-slowed-2024-target/,"September was slow for Airbus deliveries, increasing doubts about whether the manufacturer can meet its annual goals this year.<n>According to a report from Reuters, Airbus has only delivered 30 aircraft this month.<n>There are still three more days left in September, and Airbus may deliver more planes between now and Monday.<n>If the current pace is kept, then Airbus will deliver about 36 planes this month.."
"DOT Fines Air Canada $250,000 For Operating Flights Over Prohibited Iraqi Airspace","Air Canada the US Department of Transportation fined the carrier $250,000 after it was found that the carrier had flown over prohibited Iraqi airspace between 2022 and 2023. The department had jurisdiction to penalize the airline, as the flights had a United Airlines designator code through codeshare arrangements between the Canadian and Chicago-based airlines.It appears the violations occurred from Air Canada's direct flights that operated between Dubai International Airport (DXB), and Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ), through airspace that was prohibited by the FAA for US carriers.Looking at Flightradar24, on a recent flight between the two airports, you can see the deviation required to bypass the skies of Iraq. They cited that the reasoning for the 'complex security environment' that does exist over Iraq means that the Canadian carrier is required to pay $125,000 of the initial fine and $125,000 again if it violates the order once more within the next year. It would be presumed unlikely for Air Canada to face the penalty anytime soon, given that it ended its codeshare with United Airlines on the route in January 2023.The airline will fly the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to the United Arab Emirates from British Columbia four times a week.Did you know we also have an

 here?Air Canada has stressed that the flights that were caught flying over Iraqwere unplanned and accidental incidents caused by several factors, blaming air traffic control restrictions and aircraft changes that needed more time to achieve a sufficient altitude so safety would not be compromised. The Canadian carrier has noted that it has taken further action for future flights to prevent the situation from occurring again.It's not the first time an airline has been penalized for such a move. Dubai-based Emirates was also fined $1.5 million from DOT after its codeshare saw its metal pass over Iraqi airspace in June. This was the second time Emirateshads incurred the fee, the first time being in 2020.The violations go back to the time when Emirates and JetBlue had a codeshare partnership.Want answers to more key questions in aviation?

.According to Safe Air Space, civilian aircraft are restricted from flying through Iraqi airspace for several reasons. Many countries have issued airspace warnings advising operations to avoid the country, especially if flying at lower altitudes.The primary risk is due to intentional targeting from terrorist organizations that hold portable anti-aircraft weaponry. It is presumed that civil aircraft could be misidentified by local or foreign military and shot at. Drone attacks from Turkey and Iran are also common in the northern regions of Iraq, which places civil aircraft at high risk. Airspace warnings issued by foreign authorities do allow for some overflights at higher altitudes, but there remains a clear risk for civilian aircraft flying in general over Iraq.A secondary reason is GPS spoofing. In 2023, aircraft were targeted with a fake signal, which led to navigational failures. While GPS spoofing is uncommon, it has been seen several times above Iraq.GPS spoofing has led over 20 planes to veer off course in Middle Eastern airspace.",,https://simpleflying.com/dot-fines-air-canada-flights-iraqi-airspace/,"The Canadian carrier has been fined $250,000 by the US Department of Transportation.<n>It was found that the carrier had flown over prohibited Iraqi airspace between 2022 and 2023.<n>The violations occurred on direct flights between Dubai and Toronto.<n>Air Canada will pay $125,000 of the initial fine and $125,000 again if it violates the order once more within the next year.."
San Diego International: 5 Fast Facts About The Busiest Single-Runway Airport In The US,"While the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, often known as Mumbai Airport(BOM), ranks as the busiest one-runway airport in Asia, the busiest single-runway airport in the US is the San Diego International Airport (SAN). The airport is a hub for Alaska Airlines (AS) and is run by the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. Let's take a look at the five facts about SAN.In total, the airport has flights to eight non-US destinations in September.OpenedAugust 16, 1928International airport status1934Only a decade after the San Diego International Airport(SAN) started its operations, it was heavily involved in World War II. According to the US Coast Guard, Coast Guard Air Station San Diego was commissioned in April 1937. Lieutenant. S.C. Linholm, who would later become commander of the Eleventh Coast Guard District, was the first commanding officer of the Coast Guard Air Station in San Diego.The Coast Guard Air Station San Diego carried out a lot of search and rescue operations during World War II. The US Coast Guard reported about the scope of its operations:""Search and rescue operations became the primary local focus beginning in October 1943. Between January 1 and December 1, 1944, a total of 124 aircraft went down in waters covered by this unit. Of the 201 pilots and crewmen involved, 137 were saved, 59 were killed by mid-air collisions or impact with the water, and five remain lost at sea.""Like many other major airports in the US (and around the world), there was a pronounced dip in the number of annual passengers at SAN during the pandemic. Approximately 4.62 million passengers touched upon the airport in 2020, a number which is three times smaller than the figures for a year prior.Although the airport has managed to recover fairly well, as it handled 7.2 million passengers in 2021, and had even more impressive figures a year later, the airport handles far fewer passengers than the busiest airports in California.AirportAnnual number of passengersLos Angeles International Airport (LAX)More than 60 million, as reported in 2023 by Simple FlyingSan Francisco International Airport (SFO)More than 20 million, as reported by americanairportguide.comSan Diego International Airport (SAN)Over 11 million, as reported by SAN airport.San Diego International Airport (SAN) currently has two terminals. Let's take a brief look at these:TerminalDate of openingNumber of concoursesNumber of gatesTerminal 1March 5, 1967Two (East and West)fourteenTerminal 2July 11, 1979Two (East and West)thirty-twoSince late 2021, Terminal 1 at SAN has been undergoing expansion. After the completion of the expansion, Terminal 1 is expected to cover an area of 108,000 square meters (1,160,000 square feet). An area of 8,360 square meters (90,000 square feet) will be dedicated to concessions. A report by Simple Flying stated that contract value will be distributed in the following way:The expansion of the terminal is expected to create around 20,000 local jobs. This $3.8 billion project is focused on sustainability as the following projects are a part of the expansion:Ruth Alexander, a pilot who lost her life during a routine flight over San Diego, also set a record in SAN. In a book titled Remarkable Women of San Diego: Pioneers, Visionaries and Innovators, written by Hannah S. Cohen and Gloria G. Harris, the authors report that the Rulth Alexander was one among the less than a hundred pilots in the country when she set the record:"" Alexander quickly earned her pilot's license and was the sixty-fifth licensed female pilot in the country. In November 1929, she celebrated a new credential by taking-off from Lindhberg Field in a Great Lakes Biplane and continued climbing to an altitude of 15,718 ft over San Diego. Her flight was recognized as a new official altitude record for women in light planes.""After she set the record, the authors report Ruth to have said: ""I was quoted all over the newspaper. People looked at me like I was something in a zoo."" In addition to being the first woman to fly from Canada to Mexico nonstop, Ruth was also the first woman to make a round-trip flight from Canada to Mexico. Some of the other records set by her include:The first airlines to operate jets at San Diego International Airport (SAN) were United Airlines (UA) and American Airlines (AA). Two of the three big US airlines deployed the same aircraft type to commence operations at SAN with jets.AirlineAircraft usedServices toAmerican Airlines (AA)Boeing 720PhoenixUnited Airlines (UA)Boeing 720San FranciscoHowever, the airport was ready for the operations of jet aircraft a long time before the first flights took place. The airport's 8,750 ft (2,670 m) runway was constructed during its involvement in the World War II. Almost half of SAN's current area was acquired during the wars, reported militarymuseum.org:"" A total of 354.814 acres were acquired by the War Department to serve as an airport and campsite for the Army Air Forces. The entire 354.814 acres were acquired in 1942. .... Two cantonment areas, Camps Consair and Sahara, were constructed to house troops attending factory schools and other Army activities located at the airport.""Currently, many carriers offer services using jet aircraft from SAN.

You Can Now Transfer Miles Directly Between Alaska Airlines And Hawaiian Airlines,"The next phase of the Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines merger is underway. You can now officially transfer points between the programs while they work to integrate the programs entirely over the coming months.Frequent flyer miles can now be transferred for free at a 1:1 ratio between the Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan and Hawaiian Airlines HawaiianMiles programs. The expanded partnership opens up new ways for frequent flyers to acquire points in both programs or combine balances to book a trip on either carrier.Find out all the new benefits coming in the meantime and what the Government is mandating regarding consumer protections.Ensuring that points did not lose any value was a key condition of the merger's approval, and it was widely assumed that they would transfer over in the same quantities. The agreement also opens up new points transfer opportunities, as HawaiianMiles members can transfer points into the program from American Express, while Alaska partners solely with Bilt.Members can transfer as few as 50 miles up to their total available account balance. Those who maintain multiple accounts in one loyalty program must contact the corresponding loyalty program to consolidate the accounts before transferring.The process of moving points is relatively straightforward. Points.me is facilitating the exchange on a dedicated webpage. For the transfer to process, you must have frequent flyer accounts with both programs (they are free). The page will ask you to sign in to each account and then display a slider with both your balances that you can adjust to find your perfect mix of miles.Alaska Airlines is unusual in that it still uses a distance-based method of earning miles on flights. Plus there are other ways to earn.There is a minimum of 50 miles per transaction, with the upper limit reaching 500,000 miles. Once you select how many miles you want to transfer, click continue and then transfer. The process was immediate, but the airline cautioned that it may take up to 72 hours for the transaction to be reflected in the destination account and for the miles to be available for use.Improvements are still expected to arrive by the end of the year. One of the first is that elite members in either program will be able to link accounts to have their status instantly matched to the other program. For customers who fly with both carriers, the potential rewards are even higher, as anyone who earns elite-qualifying miles (EQMs) in both Mileage Plan and HawaiianMiles in 2024 will have the potential to be awarded an even higher status based on the combined EQM balance.Get the latest aviation news straight to your inbox:

NTSB Issues Urgent Safety Recommendations For Boeing 737 Rudder Controls,"In February, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft operated by United Airlines experienced a stuck rudder pedal upon landing at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR).The incident resulted in the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB) investigation. Nearly eight months later, the regulatory watchdog has issued an urgent safety recommendation regarding the incident and aircraft type. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is expected to weigh in soon.According to Reuters, the NTSB’s investigation has been ongoing for the last eight months and has found that the issue lies with the rudder actuator. The actuator can jam when moisture accumulates inside the housing and freezes at high altitudes and low temperatures. Collins Aerospace, a subsidiary of RTX, manufactures the component.RTX said in a statement that it:""[continues] to work closely with the NTSB and Boeing on this investigation. We are supporting Boeing and operators to mitigate operational impacts.""The manufacturer identified that a bearing was incorrectly assembled during production, allowing moisture to enter the component. The error affected more than 353 actuators delivered to Boeing since February 2017.The actuator is part of an optional autoland system. As a result, it doesn’t affect most 737 aircraft. However, these components are present on both older 737 Next Generation and early MAX models, as they share the same rudder system.Boeing provided a statement regarding the issue last month, saying:""[We have informed] affected 737 operators of a potential condition with the rudder rollout guidance actuator, which is part of an optional autoland system. The autoland system includes layers of redundancy, and we are working with our supplier to develop additional guidance to address the potential condition.""United Airlines found that the part was used in only nine of its 737 aircraft. All of these aircraft were originally built for other airlines. The airline has reported that these components have been removed, which prevents a possible repeat of the issue experienced by Flight UA1539. The NTSB has also confirmed that no 737s in the US operate with the affected actuators.The NTSB has recommended that Boeing notify flight crews and operators about the possibility of the rudder control system jamming and that the manufacturer ""determine appropriate flight crew responses besides applying maximum pedal force"" in case a stuck pedal situation occurs.It also recommends that the FAA determine whether some actuators should be removed from airplanes and whether planes using these actuators should be halted until replacement units are installed, effectively grounding the affected aircraft. The NTSB also directed the FAA to notify international aviation regulators about the issue, allowing them to choose their own course of action.When the moisture in the actuator freezes, it prevents both pilots from controlling the rudder. In February’s incident, the rudder controls were non-responsive during the landing rollout phase, which resulted in the Captain keeping the aircraft on centerline using the nosewheel steering tiller. Shortly after, the controls worked as intended. The aircraft taxied back to the gate without assistance with no injuries to its 161 passengers and crew members.While the issue seems momentary, presumably until the actuator thaws and can move freely again, the results could be catastrophic if the rudder gets stuck at full deflection during a landing.Five airlines have already taken delivery of Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 aircraft.",,https://simpleflying.com/ntsb-issues-urgent-boeing-737-rudder-controls-safety-recommendations/,"In February, a Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft experienced a stuck rudder pedal upon landing at Newark Liberty International Airport.<n>The incident resulted in the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) investigation.<n>The NTSB has now issued an urgent safety recommendation regarding the incident and aircraft type.<n>It recommends that Boeing notify flight crews and operators about the possibility of the rudder control system jamming.<n>The FAA is expected to weigh in soon.."
Boeing's Spirit AeroSystems Considering Furloughs As Machinist Strike Continues,"Spirit AeroSystems, a tier 1 supplier for Boeing that is in the process of merging with the aircraft manufacturer, has considered furloughs if the machinists strike at Boeing’s facilities in the Pacific Northwest and California continue.Joe Buccino, a spokesperson for Spirit AeroSystems, told Simple Flying that the company has been reviewing its contingency plans regarding furloughs.“No decisions have been made at this time.”The Financial Times (FT) first reported about the potential furloughs that could happen in three weeks if strikes at Boeing continue.The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) District Lodge 751 and District W24 have been striking since their contract expired on September 13.While the manufacturer and the unions’ negotiating committees had agreed upon a tentative agreement (TA), the unions’ members voted against it and approved a strike, which has been going on for two weeks now.Boeing's trouble just got worse when more than 30,000 employees voted to go on strike from midnight.However, Boeing reacted much quicker, and in an attempt to conserve cash, the aircraft manufacturer announced far-reaching cash-saving measures, including its own rolling furloughs.The company’s other actions have also included a hiring freeze, stopping non-essential travel, and other non-manufacturing-related expenses.In addition, Boeing was also planning to significantly reduce supplier expenditures, stopping issuing the majority of its purchase orders on the Boeing 737, 767, and 777 programs during the strike.Neither Boeing nor Spirit AeroSystems has yet quantified the financial impact of the strike. Spirit AeroSystems, which announced a $415 million net loss in Q2 on August 5, said that it would stop providing guidance and canceled its Q2 earnings call due to its pending merger with Boeing.The two companies signed a definitive agreement in June and announced the deal to the public on July 1. Boeing made the move in order to improve the quality and safety of its products, including the 737 MAX, with the acquisition helping the manufacturer and the supplier align their production systems, including the safety and quality management systems, according to the now-former chief executive officer (CEO) of Boeing, David Calhoun.At the time, Boeing stated that it should clear the required regulatory approvals and complete the transaction in mid-2025.Boeing is in the final stages of acquiring its once-owned sites in Wichita, Kansas, which have been operating as Spirit AeroSystems.Nevertheless, Boeing, IAM, and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) will continue negotiating on the machinists’ contract on September 27. Talks, which were mediated by the FMCS, broke down on September 18.However, Boeing directly presented its supposedly final offer to the two IAM lodges on September 23. The union and its members responded negatively to the offer, with the IAM District 751 saying that the direct contract offer was an attempt to bypass the negotiating committee and was disrespectful to the union’s members and the bargaining process.While Boeing initially set the ratification deadline to September 27, IAM District 751 said that its members would not vote on that date. The company later extended the deadline, yet the move to put forth a non-negotiated contract did not pan out for Boeing, and the strike has continued.On September 26, IAM District reiterated that it does not bargain through the press and the only way to get its members to get back to work was “through meaningful negotiations.”The meeting will be the latest attempt to resolve the machinists' strike that has been going on since September 13.",,https://simpleflying.com/boeing-spirit-aerosystems-considers-furlough-strike-continues/,"The International Association of Machin ists and Aerospace Workers ( IAM ) District Lodge 751 and District W 24 have been striking since September 13.<n>Spirit Aero Systems, a tier 1 supplier for Boeing that is in the process of merging with the aircraft manufacturer.<n>A spokesperson for Spirit Aero Systems said that the company has been reviewing its contingency plans regarding furlough s.<n>No decisions have been made at this time.."

Southwest Airlines Appoints Former Spirit Airlines CEO Robert Fornaro To Board Of Directors,"Southwest Airlines has appointed Robert Fornaro to its board of directors as it continues to overhaul its board amidst a proxy battle with activist investor Elliot Investment Management (Elliott).The airline announced the appointment on September 26, the same day it held its investor day, where it presented multiple changes to its business model.The airline described Fornaro as an accomplished executive with four decades of experience in the aviation industry.The incoming board member served on the board of directors of Spirit Airlines, as well as being the chief executive officer (CEO) of the low-cost carrier.Fornaro served in those roles between May 2014 and September 2019 and January 2016 and December 2018, respectively.Incidentally, Fornaro was the president and CEO of AirTran Airways, an airline that Southwest Airlines acquired in 2011, from November 2007 until May 2011.The executive worked with Southwest Airlines between 2011 and 2014 and again from 2020 to 2024 after vacating his Spirit Airlines job.Looking back at the Orlando-headquartered carrier.Gary Kelly, the executive chairman of the board of Southwest Airlines, who will resign in May 2025, said that Fornaro was an exceptional leader with a lot of industry experience.“As a former consultant to Southwest, Bob has provided an objective review and important perspective on Southwest's transformation plan, and he has a strong appreciation for Southwest's unique business model and strategic advantages.”Kelly concluded that Fornaro’s deep experience while leading multiple airlines will be instrumental as the carrier continues with its board refreshment plan to add best-in-class directors.Kelly added that he would bring complementary skills and hold Southwest Airlines’ leadership accountable.Fornaro said that Southwest Airlines has a storied history and a lot of potential. The executive stated that he was looking forward to further collaborating with the board members.“I am confident in Bob Jordan and the Leadership Team's ability to execute its transformation plan and deliver improved performance and Shareholder returns.”On September 10, Southwest Airlines announced the departure of seven board members, including Kelly. While the current executive chairman will depart the carrier’s board after its annual meeting in May, six directors will step down in November.In addition to Rakesh Gangwal, the co-founder of IndiGo, Southwest Airlines has planned to add four more directors to its board, thus reducing the number of directors to 13 and 12 once Kelly resigns and retires.Gangwal joined the carrier’s board in July. The former US Airways and IndiGo executive also brings plenty of airline experience to Southwest Airlines.The carrier’s Chairman, Gary Kelly, will retire next year after spending more than 15 years in the role.When Elliott announced its significant shareholding in Southwest Airlines and planned to transform the airline under the ‘Stronger Southwest’ moniker in June, the activist investor said that one of its goals was to replace Bob Jordan, the president and CEO of Southwest Airlines, Kelly, and the remainder of the board.“The Board should be reconstituted with new, truly independent directors from outside of Southwest who have best-in-class expertise in airlines, customer experience, and technology.”It would surprise few that Fornaro, who has worked with Southwest Airlines for a collective seven years, would not satisfy Elliott and its calls for an independent board.When the airline announced Gangwal's appointment to the board, Elliott said Southwest Airlines chose him in part because of his support for the company’s current leadership and the “status quo.”“These actions demonstrate how profoundly out of touch Southwest’s Board has become with shareholder sentiment and with the reality of the situation, said the letter.”Elliot reiterated that shareholders have lost trust in Southwest Airlines’ leadership and do not believe that they are capable of devising a plan to turn the airline’s situation around.On September 24, Elliott called for shareholders to make sure they can vote with their shares as the investment firm will call a special meeting to initiate the leadership changes it has sought.Elliott Investment Management has continued to express its dissatisfaction with Southwest Airlines' current CEO.",,https://simpleflying.com/southwest-airlines-appoints-former-spirit-airlines-ceo-robert-fornaro-board-of-directors/,"Robert For naro served on the board of directors of Spirit Airlines, as well as being the chief executive officer ( CEO) of the low - cost carrier.<n>For naro was the president and CEO of Air Tran Airways, an airline that Southwest Airlines acquired in 2011, from November 2007 until May 2011.<n>The executive worked with Southwest Airlines between 2011 and 2014 and again from 2020 to 2024 after vac ating his Spirit Airlines job.<n>The airline announced the appointment on September 26, the same day it held its investor day..

"Elliott: Southwest Airlines Has Seen ""Billions Of Dollars Of Profitability Deterioration"" Under CEO Bob Jordan","Elliott Investment Management (Elliott), an activist investment firm that has launched a proxy battle against Southwest Airlines’ management, has continued to criticize the airline and its leadership, reiterating its calls for the removal of the chief executive officer (CEO) of the carrier.After Southwest Airlines had presented its three-year transformation plan on September 26, Elliott issued its statement in response to the changes announced at the airline’s Investor Day.“Today’s Investor Day will have a familiar ring for many shareholders: Another promise of a better tomorrow from the same people who have created the problems we face today.”The investment firm continued that without credible leadership to execute this plan, which was filled with long-dated promises of better financial performance, the plan risked becoming the latest in the airline’s long series of failed improvement initiatives.Elliott highlighted that in 2021 and 2022, Southwest Airlines made similar promises that would enhance its profitability in the billions. Instead, the carrier’s profitability has deteriorated in the billions under the leadership of Bob Jordan, the president and CEO of Southwest Airlines, the investment firm alleged.During the airline’s investor day in December 2021, back when its CEO was still Gary Kelly, the current executive chairman of the board until May 2025, it estimated its new strategic initiatives should deliver $1 billion to $1.5 billion of incremental earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2023.The initiatives included Southwest Business, participation in the global distribution system (GDS), a new fare product with a modern revenue management system (RMS), a new Chase co-brand credit card agreement, and fleet modernization to maintain its low-cost advantage.However, the latter point hinged on Boeing delivering the 737 MAX 7. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) still has not certified the type, nor the largest 737 MAX type, the MAX 10.Southwest Airlines' investor day in December 2022, with Jordan having taken over the reins of the company by then, only provided an update to the plans it unveiled in 2021. Southwest Airlines said that it had completed all of its initiatives except one, namely modernizing its RMS. At the time, the company had estimated the completion of that process by mid-2023.Still, the airline also said that after focusing on ‘the basics’ in 2022, it was ready to move past them in 2023.With a strong outlook for the remainder of Q4, Southwest is reinstating its quarterly dividend in 2023.Nevertheless, Elliott has continued questioning Jordan’s leadership, asking whether the CEO, who has “delivered years of unacceptable financial results,” was the right person to execute the transformational initiatives announced during the latest investor day.The investment firm added that Jordan was not, noting that following “extensive engagement with Southwest’s leadership,” it came to the conclusion that the airline’s leadership was incapable of delivering on the carrier’s potential.Elliott’s previous statements said that while the two parties have been discussing issues related to the airline, Southwest Airlines has refused to budge regarding Jordan’s job at the airline.“Today’s announcement that adding assigned seating and premium products will take multiple years to implement – when peers have implemented similar changes in much shorter time frames – is further evidence that […] Jordan lacks the vision and capability to execute on these initiatives.”According to Elliott, the day was filled with more long-date promises, through which Jordan was playing for time and not success. However, the investment firm jabbed that ""his toys"" were shareholders’ cash.The investment firm concluded that it has remained adamant about calling a special shareholders’ meeting to elect an independent and “best-in-class Board of Directors” to secure a stronger Southwest Airlines.When Elliott initially announced its significant shareholding in the airline, it presented its plan to get the carrier back on its feet in June, titling it ‘Stronger Southwest.’The warnings about a special meeting came just two days before Southwest Airlines' Investor Day.Southwest Airlines introduced its transformative business plan, ‘Southwest. Even Better,’ during its investor day on September 26.In addition to announcing new transformative measures, the carrier also shared more details about the already-announced changes to its seating processes, including assigned and premium seating, red-eye flights, and overall cabin improvements.Its free bag policy will continue, with the airline arguing that it would lose out more on market share quantified in dollars than it would earn revenue from bag fees.A ground-breaking change was Southwest Airlines' announcement of a partnership with Icelandair, its first-ever partnership with an airline. The carrier teased that at least one more partnership should be finalized in 2025.Simple Flying previously explored the changes that Southwest Airlines announced on September 26 here:The plan also includes partnerships with international airlines, starting with Icelandair.",,https://simpleflying.com/elliott-southwest-airlines-billions-profitability-deterioration-ceo-bob-jordan/,"Activist investment firm has continued to criticize the airline and its leadership.<n> reiterating its calls for the removal of the chief executive officer ( CEO ) of the carrier.<n>Southwest Airlines introduced its transformative business plan, ‘ Southwest.<n>Even Better, ’ during its investor day on September 26.<n>In addition to announcing new transformative measures, the carrier also announced changes to its seating processes..

Delta Air Lines Plans Future Airbus A350-1000 Long-Haul Routes,"Delta Air Lines’ CEO got candid during a roundtable discussion with local business leaders in Minneapolis and spoke about the carrier’s plans to welcome new airplanes that would allow it to resume services to places like India. The carrier hasn’t flown to India in the last few years, and recent geopolitical issues have affected its plans to resume flights.At a recent roundtable discussion, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian discussed, among many other things, the carrier’s plans to start services on several long-haul routes once the new long-range Airbus A350-1000 aircraft arrive in its fleet.According to Thrifty Traveler, Delta is eyeing flights to India, Saudi Arabia, and beyond in the coming years. Delta once had scheduled flights to Mumbai but has not served India since the pandemic.But that can change once it gets its A350-1000 planes, which can cover the massive distance between the United States and India. Bastian added, ""We really want to serve that market directly,"" and said that passengers can expect nonstop flights to India ""within the next couple of years.""A lot has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced Delta, along with many other global airlines, to axe several routes from its network. The Russia-Ukraine war and the resulting sanctions have closed Russian airspace for most Western carriers, including those in the US.Russia is essential for air connectivity between the US and India, and while airlines can still operate flights between the two countries with an alternative route (American Airlines flies to New Delhi), it has its disadvantages.Get all the latest 
aviation news for North America
 here.Delta’s current Airbus A350-900 can make the journey to India but will have to compromise on the number of passengers or cargo it can carry, given the circuitous route. Interestingly, Indian carriers like Air India are allowed to use Russian airspace, allowing the carrier to save fuel and time compared to US carriers. But once Delta acquires the A350-1000, it wouldn’t face such problems because of the longer range of the aircraft.Delta is building a solid foundation even before beginning flights to India and Saudi Arabia by forming partnerships with local airlines. For example, it has already signed a partnership deal with the yet-to-start Riyadh Air, with the hope of strengthening connectivity and expanding both carriers’ networks.Even for its India flights and connectivity, Delta plans to partner with the country’s biggest airline, IndiGo. Bastian said that Delta would soon announce the partnership with the Indian low-cost giant but did not provide any more details about the structure or extent of that partnership.Another partnership of Delta’s that received significant press coverage this year is that with Aeromexico. The DOT said earlier this year that the two airlines must prepare to break the deal, but Thrifty Traveler quotes Peter Carter, Delta's executive vice president for external affairs, as saying,“We're expecting that we will get an order, which will be good news. We were expecting that they were going to terminate the joint venture, basically, by May. And our joint venture is alive and well.”",,https://simpleflying.com/delta-air-lines-plans-future-airbus-a350-long-haul-flights/,Delta hasn't flown to India since the CO VID -19 pandemic.<n>The carrier is expected to get new long - range Airbus A 350 -1000 planes.<n>The planes would allow it to resume services to India.<n>It also plans to partner with local carriers in India and Saudi Arabia..
More Flight Capacity: Harry Reid International Airport Modernization Plan Proposes Major Expansion,"Airport officials and the Clark County Commission are considering a large-scale expansion at Las Vegas' Harry Reid International Airport. The expansion would increase the existing terminal capacity by building dozens of new gates.Additionally, external improvements will be made to connectivity so passengers have better access to the airport terminals, and new internal facilities will be built to enable seamless inter-terminal connectivity within the airport.Las Vegas' Harry Reid International Airport (LAS) could potentially see a large-scale expansion soon. Airport officials and the Clark County Commission are reviewing plans to expand the airport's existing terminal one to increase gate capacity and subsequently increase passenger traffic.As the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, airport officials are considering expanding Terminal 1, which would increase the number of gates from 39 to 65. If the additional 26 gates were built, the number of aircraft the terminal can accommodate at any given time would increase by around 66%.If approved, the new proposed gates will reportedly be built as a new wing to Terminal 1, close to where the airport's previous Terminal 2 used to be located. The airport's Terminal 3 will also see some modifications, such as redesigning the pedestrian flow to accommodate passenger movements across the facility and onto their flights.It has been reported that upon completing the modifications to Terminal 3, it will be renamed as Terminal 2.Simple Flying has reached out to LAS Airport to learn more details about the proposed expansion and how this will help with the future growth of the airport. Any response received will be updated in this article.As part of the airport's expansion and upgrades, upgrades to the road network surrounding the airport are reported to be considered. While the airport will maintain its one-way circular roadway system, it is considering building a flyover bridge to offer better connectivity to Terminal 2 from Paradise Road.Additionally, two multimodal centers are under consideration, which passengers can use to better access various public transport options, ride-hailing services, and parking facilities for airport crew members and employees.Reports also stated that with these improvements, the airport is looking to balance carriers across the two terminals by consolidating some airline operations at Terminal 2, thereby alleviating congestion at Terminal 1.LAS airport has been experiencing significant growth recently, so much so that it is forecasted to exceed its pre-pandemic international passenger traffic by 4% by the end of this year. This is partly due to an influx of new international services announced recently. While Virgin Atlantic resumed services to Vegas from Manchester, Irish carrier Aer Lingus is set to launch seasonal services to Vegas from Dublin next month.Services will operate thrice weekly with convenient connections from the UK and Europe.Closer to home, airlines such as Air Canada will upgrade their equipment used on services to Vegas seasonally to provide more capacity by using larger widebody aircraft such as the Airbus A330s and the Boeing 777s.Some of the carriers increasing services to Las Vegas (or planning to) include:Norse Atlantic AirwaysBreeze AirwaysFrontier AirlinesFurthermore, the expansion is currently being considered because the airport is close to reaching capacity, and without it, its growth would stagnate.However, while plans for upgrading LAS are currently being considered, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), earlier this year, approved an additional airport in Las Vegas for private aviation.The new Las Vegas Executive Airport would be located 30 miles west of Harry Reid International Airport.",,https://simpleflying.com/harry-reid-international-airport-major-expansion-modernization-plan/,Airport officials and the Clark County Commission are considering a large - scale expansion at Las Vegas'Harry Reid International Airport.<n>The expansion would increase the existing terminal capacity by building dozens of new gates.<n>External improvements will be made to connectivity so passengers have better access to the airport terminals.<n>New internal facilities will be built to enable seamless inter - terminal connectivity within the airport..

9+ Million Passengers: Los Angeles’s 15 Most Popular International Destinations,"In the 12 months to July 2024, Los Angeles International had non-stop and one-stop same-plane service to 78 international destinations, including a one-off service to Nice. Of course, passengers could also transfer en route to reach many other places.Examining booking data shows that approximately 39% of its total international traffic had to connect. I recently looked at San Francisco's largest unserved long-haul markets and will examine Los Angeles' soon.Emirates began flying to the US 20 years ago in 2004.They are shown below. All data is point-to-point (regardless of whether non-stop or not) at the city level. Figures are rounded from Los Angeles International only for the year to July. Of course, the results would be different at the airport level, although London Heathrow would be first with 982,000—more on the London market below.'PDEW' means passengers daily each way and ignores seasonality, which can be significant. The base fare is one-way and excludes taxes, any fuel surcharge, and other add-ons. It is averaged across all passengers in all classes.In the year to July, this city pair had more than 1.1 million roundtrip point-to-point passengers: London Heathrow 981,000 and Gatwick 122,000. About 93% flew non-stop, and the rest connected en route.Those figures are just for those who traveled between the two cities. Many people also transited to other flights in London and Los Angeles, but this is not covered here.Quite a few things change in the coming months.As traffic is considerable, so is capacity. An average of 11 daily flights across the year helped, although there were as many as 13 daily and as few as seven.Six carriers had non-stop flights: American Airlines, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Virgin Atlantic to Heathrow and Norse Atlantic to Gatwick. Delta pulled out in May 2024, while Norse began flights in June 2023.Unsurprisingly, the base fares varied massively. Reflecting Heathrow's premium nature and the number of first and business travelers, point-to-point passengers paid an average of $878 one-way (again, for all passengers and all cabins).Which is your favourite addition?In contrast, it was less than half that at Gatwick ($431). Most Gatwick passengers flew with Norse, and that average fare was for its economy and premium cabins before revenue from bags, food, etc., were included.

Which Airlines Dominate The Cargo Sector & Why?,"In 2023, the global air cargo market reached a size of over $250 billion, making it one of the most valuable transport-related industries on the planet, albeit still lagging behind the commercial air transportation market. With a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) expected to be around 10% for the industry as a whole over the next five years, freight airlines are in a strong position to continue developing their networks and fleet, according to an analysis from Grand View Research.Get all the latest 
aviation news
 from Simple Flying!The outlook for the industry was not so positive just a few years ago when, before the COVID-19 pandemic, air cargo operators were worried about the increasing reliability of ocean-going cargo. Massive container ships were, and still are, vastly cheaper to operate on a freight basis, and at the end of the day, many feared that consumers would lose interest in the high prices associated with speedier air cargo deliveries.When the pandemic came around and everyone was forced back into their homes, only shopping exploded, and the rapid demand for goods made the case for air cargo much stronger. During the years following the global travel slowdown, namely 2021 and 2022, air cargo demand reached its highest levels ever. Data from Statista demonstrated that the total market size of the global air cargo sector jumped from just $166.3 billion in 2020 to nearly $240 billion in 2021, a number which remained similarly high in 2022 where it sat at $218.6 billion.The airline appointed a new Vice President and and Executive Vice President of its parent company.In the past two years, the consumer economy has shifted heavily to favor goods that can be delivered quickly, as the trend away from in-person shopping has drifted even into food, clothing, and other essentials. As a result, air cargo demand has only continued to grow, with more packages than ever finding their way onto the aircraft operated by cargo airlines like FedEx, UPS, and others.Despite all of these industry changes, the air cargo sector's industrial organization has remained mostly the same, with only a handful of airlines dominating the market. This makes sense from a microeconomic perspective, as cargo airlines are expensive to operate and require immense start-up capital, making the barrier of entry for competitors exceptionally high. Let's take a deeper look at the handful of cargo airlines that control this unique market.There are three kinds of cargo airlines which are typically among those that rank as the industry's largest. Each of these kinds of carriers brings unique advantages to the table and targets a different sector of the air cargo customer market. They are as follows:Examples of scheduled cargo airlines include FedEx Express and UPS Airlines, both cargo carriers from the United States with extensive fleets and networks. Examples of cargo subdivisions may include Qatar Airways Cargo and Emirates SkyCargo, each of which maintains a unique fleet of dedicated cargo planes. Lastly, an example of a charter operator might be Atlas Air, which offers on-demand aerial mobility for customers.There are multiple ways to measure the size of a cargo airline. For starters, many would want to use revenue, market capitalization, or profitability as a measure of an airline's prominence or industry importance. As many of these carriers are private companies or subdivisions of others, these statistics are not always available.The most universal metric for the size of a cargo airline's operations is scheduled freight tonne-kilometers, which is the summation of both how much cargo a particular airline flies and also how far it flies this amount of cargo. As a result, one can get a better picture of the size and scale of a carrier's operations. Here is a list of the ten largest cargo airlines by their scheduled freight tonne-kilometers (in billions) for 2023, with 2018 data for reference:Airline:Scheduled freight tonne-kilometers (2023):Scheduled freight tonne-kilometers (2018):FedEx Express17.919.6Qatar Airways Cargo14.413.7UPS Airlines14.214.3Emirates SkyCargo10.69.6Atlas Air8.94.5Korean Air Cargo8.48.1Turkish Cargo8.36.9Cathay Pacific Cargo8.18.1China Southern Airlines Cargo7.66.5Cargolux6.87.3Except for charter operator Atlas Air (which was relatively young at the time), we notice that there has been relatively little change to the airlines that dominate the air cargo market. For the most part, those airlines controlling the market today are the same as those that did so back in 2018.Noticeably, however, European and US airlines have both lost ground in the market, with FedEx registering 1.7 million fewer freight tonne-kilometers last year than it did before the pandemic in 2018. A similar story is true for European cargo operator Cargolux, which could likely drop from the top ten next year.From a windowless design to the carrying space shuttle, there's a lot about freighter aircraft that we don't know about.The same is not true, however, for Middle Eastern cargo operators like Emirates SkyCargo, Qatar Airways Cargo and, most noticeably, Turkish Cargo, which have all seen their numbers increase significantly.

Brazilian Airline May Be 1st Outside Of Asia To Buy China's COMAC C919 Planes,"A small Brazilian cargo and charter airline, Total Linhas Aereas, might be lining up an order for the COMAC C919, the Chinese competitor to the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 Max aircraft families.According to a report by Reuters, Total Linhas Aereas, a Brazil-based cargo and charter carrier, has been talking with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China ( Comac) about an order for four C919 aircraft.One of the airline’s executives will visit the Chinese planemaker in October to advance talks, the report added, noting that Silvio Costa Filho, the Ports and Airports Minister of Brazil, said that the government was aware of the carrier’s plans yet Total Linhas Aereas had no formal plan currently.The carrier told Reuters that it was forced to look for alternatives since Airbus and Boeing have sold out their A320neo and 737 MAX delivery slots until the next decade, while Embraer did not offer a large enough aircraft type for the airline.Currently, Total Linhas Aereas has eight aircraft in its fleet, namely one ATR 42-500, three Boeing 727 converted freighters, and four 737-400 converted freighters, with an average age of 29.4 years.The 727s have an average age of 46.3 years, ch-aviation data showed. Meanwhile, the ATR 42-500, registered as PR-TTK, was being operated on behalf of Petrobras, the state-owned petroleum company, the site’s fleet records indicated.The country is home to several airframes that have exceeded 35 years of service.The only firm orders that have been placed for the C919 have come from Chinese airlines and the country’s aircraft leasing companies.Ch-aviation fleet records showed that COMAC’s backlog includes 680 aircraft, with the Chinese aircraft manufacturer having delivered 15 aircraft, including six testbeds utilized by COMAC.Airline operators that already have C919s include China Eastern Airlines (seven), Air China (one), and China Southern Airlines (one).On April 29, China Southern Airlines said that it had entered into an agreement with COMAC to purchase 100 C919s, becoming the last airline out of China’s big three to order 100 units of the Chinese-built aircraft.The three carriers have 98, 104, and four C919s in their backlogs, respectively, with the remaining 474 aircraft currently not being assigned to any airline. However, ch-aviation data might not have taken into account China Southern Airlines’ agreement.A Brunei-based startup airline, GallopAir, has also ordered the C919, as well as COMAC’s other jet, the ARJ21. In total, the carrier purchased 30 aircraft from COMAC, split between 15 ARJ21s and 15 C919s. The airline should launch operations by the end of the year with an ARJ21.China Southern, like China Eastern, ordered the C919 basic version, while Air China ordered the C919 extended-range version.China Eastern Airlines took delivery of its first C919 in December 2022, introducing it into service in May 2023.Since then, the airline has taken delivery of six more C919s, with the most recent delivery being on July 29. However, the schedule data from the aviation analytics company Cirium showed that Chinese airlines have had a fluctuating schedule of flights that are operated by the type.For example, in April, just before China Eastern Airlines took delivery of its sixth C919, the airline had scheduled 94 weekly departures with the type, which was the same as in March. Yet in May, the airline had 80 weekly departures with the C919.During the following two months, China Eastern Airlines scheduled 104 and 126 weekly departures with the type, finishing off the summer with 154 weekly flights in August.By September, China Eastern Airlines had reduced the number of weekly itineraries with the C919 to 146, with China Airlines now scheduling 22 weekly departures during the month.In October, China Airlines and China Southern Airlines have planned 28 weekly departures with the type each, while China Eastern Airlines should operate 154 weekly flights with the domestically built jet.COMAC has cleared one more hurdle towards getting the C919 certified in Europe.",,https://simpleflying.com/brazilian-airline-may-be-1st-outside-asia-buy-comac-c919-planes/,"Cargo and charter carrier Total Lin has A ere as, a Brazil - based cargo and charter carrier.<n>Has been talking with the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China about an order for four C 919 aircraft.<n>Currently, Total Lin has eight aircraft in its fleet, including an ATR 42 -500 and three Boeing 727 converted freighter s..

US Airline Breeze Airways Continues To See Flight Network And Revenue Growth,"Breeze Airways has experienced ""tremendous"" revenue growth so far in 2024, according to the carrier's Chief Commercial Officer, Lukas Johnson. The airline commenced operations in May 2021 and reported its first operating profit in March this year, as measured in revenue per available seat mile (RASM).Since then, things have gone from strength to strength, and in an interview with Aviation Week, Johnson attributed the revenue growth to the airline's maturing presence in various markets, adding,“We've made huge gains this year. We don't really disclose on a monthly basis, but every single month this year has shown tremendous [year-over-year] growth in unit revenue.”Breeze Airways positions itself as a premium low-cost carrier, and has established an impressive niche for itself in the market. Rather than operating from one large hub to another, the airline focuses on connecting smaller destinations, and it does not face any direct competition on more than 80% of its routes.On the back of its growing financial performance, Breeze Airways has ambitious expansion plans when it comes to its route network, and later this year will launch three new routes from its base at Vero Beach Regional Airport (VRB) in Florida:Currently, Breeze Airways is the only commercial airline to operate at Vero Beach, and connects the airport to a handful of destinations across the northeast, including Hartford (BDL), Providence (PVD), White Plains (HPN), and Long Island (ISP). Vero Beach is located on Florida's Atlantic coast, some 85 miles southeast of Orlando and 65 miles north of West Palm Beach.As reported by Vero News, the Founder and CEO of Breeze Airways, David Neeleman, said,“After announcing service to New Haven from Vero Beach just a couple of weeks ago, we’re back with more. Vero Beach has never seen service to Dulles, and connecting Vero Beach Regional Airport with the nation’s capital will no doubt be a huge addition for the community.”The carrier will also add a new network point to its route map - Ogdensburg International Airport (OGS), with service from Washington (IAD). This will be the only commercial service to operate at the facility, located in St. Lawrence County, close to the Canadian border. The flight will be a continuation of the service from Vero Beach, but passengers will not need to change aircraft in Washington to travel between the two.It is not only Breeze Airways' route network that is expanding - the carrier's fleet is also due to grow significantly over the coming years. The latest data from ch-aviation shows that Breeze Airways currently has a total of 41 aircraft in its fleet, made up of 28 Airbus A220-300s, 10 Embraer 190s, and 3 Embraer 195s.Breeze Airways also has a further 61 Airbus A220-300s on order, which are due to arrive by the end of 2028. Each of the airline's A220 aircraft features a two-class layout, made up of 12 seats in first class and 125 in economy class. Johnson went on to highlight Breeze Airways' passenger experience on the A220, saying,“Most of our [passengers] are comparing the experience to a regional jet, and then they get onboard [the A220] and they're blown away. It's a brand-new, larger jet. The feedback has been awesome.”",,https://simpleflying.com/breeze-airways-network-revenue-growth/,"Breeze Airways has experienced 'trem end ous' revenue growth so far in 2024.<n>The carrier commenced operations in May 2021 and reported its first operating profit in March this year.<n>Later this year, the airline will launch three new routes from its base at Vero Beach Regional Airport in Florida.."
11 Passengers Experience Heat Illness After GlobalX Airlines Airbus A320 Loses Air Conditioning,"An Immigrations and Customs Enforcement aircraft operating for the United States had to divert and return to the airport of departure after the air conditioner onboard the aircraft experienced issues. Reports suggest that around a dozen passengers experienced heat-related illness, which resulted in them being transported to a local hospital upon landing back at Gateway Airport.Yesterday, a GlobalXAirbus A320-200 aircraft, shortly after departing from Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, Arizona, experienced a technical issue with the air conditioning system onboard, according to reports from FOX10. This issue prompted the flight crew to divert the aircraft back to Gateway Airport. Reports indicate that the aircraft involved was a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plane.Data from FlightRadar24.com shows that the A320 was originally planned to fly to Alexandria, Louisiana before a technical issue forced the aircraft to land back at Gateway 30 minutes after the initial departure.According to the GPS data available, the aircraft climbed to an altitude of almost 20,000 feet before commencing its descent back to Gateway. While it has not flown since the incident, data shows that the aircraft is scheduled to fly to Alexandria once again later today, suggesting that the technical issue with it is expected to be rectified by then.Simple Flying has contacted GlobalX for further details regarding the incident. Any response will be updated in this article.While being onboard an aircraft without air conditioning can be uncomfortable at the best of times, the high temperatures of Phoenix, Arizona, had a negative impact on the passengers aboard the aircraft. Reportedly, 11 passengers suffered heat illness and were transported to a local hospital after the aircraft landed back at Gateway Airport.According to data reported by KTAR news yesterday, the city of Phoenix broke a 35-year-old heat record, with temperatures as high as 113 Degrees Fahrenheit (45 Degrees Celsius) measured at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX).Considering jet aircraft are pressurized, the lack of external airflow, along with the record-high temperatures outside, would certainly have taken a toll on the passengers. If a member of the flight crew or cabin crew had been affected, there could have been serious flight safety concerns.Additionally, an issue with the aircraft's air conditioning system could sometimes also negatively impact the cabin pressurization.Air conditioning onboard aircraft is essentially air taken in by the engines, which is then cooled and pressurized, and pumped into the cabin, thereby keeping the temperatures low and the cabin pressurized. The air pressurizes the cabin to around 8,000 feet* (also known as Cabin Altitude), and the air is circulated as required and is expelled from the aircraft via the outflow valve.*Latest generation aircraft such as the Airbus A350 has an even lower cabin altitude.Thus, an issue with the aircraft's air conditioning system would mean that, apart from not being able to control the temperature, the lack of proper airflow could also affect the pressurization capabilities of the aircraft, which can have catastrophic consequences.A pressurization failure can result in everyone onboard suffering from hypoxia due to a lack of oxygen. While the use of oxygen masks onboard should enable passengers to stay conscious and pilots to safely bring the aircraft down to a safe altitude, if the onset of hypoxia is not recognized or there is an explosive cabin depressurization, the chances of survival are quite low.The crash of Helios Airways Flight 522 in August 2005 remains one of the most infamous instances of in-flight hypoxia.The higher the altitude, the more drastic the pressurization change and the lower the reaction time available to put on the oxygen masks.",,https://simpleflying.com/heat-illness-globalx-airbus-a320-air-conditioning-diverts-phoenix-mesa/,"An Immigration s and Customs Enforcement aircraft operating for the United States had to divert and return to the airport of departure after the air conditioner experienced issues.<n>Reports suggest that around a dozen passengers experienced heat - related illness, which resulted in them being transported to a local hospital upon landing back at Gateway Airport.<n>Data from Flight Radar 24. com shows that the aircraft originally planned to fly to Alexandria, Louisiana.."
